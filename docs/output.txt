### Transfer of Credit from Other Institutions
#### Undergraduate Transfer Credit
Course credit earned at other institutions of higher education may be
transferable. Credit transfer is made by the admission evaluators while
conducting the admission evaluation. The transfer of credit is done at the
program-of-study level, topic area level, the major and major selectable
levels and on a case-by-case basis. The following statements apply to all
transfer credits:
  * The SFBU Admissions Office must receive all _official transcripts_ prior to the student's joining a degree program. Without preapproval, transcripts received after the student joins SFBU cannot be used in transferring credits, except for records from the term immediately preceding the student's starting semester at SFBU. Up to 75 units of courses that have been reviewed and currently approved as part of a formal SFBU articulation/transfer agreement are guaranteed to transfer.
  * The student was officially enrolled in the course.
  * Courses eligible for transfer by prearranged transfer/articulation agreement shall follow the details contained in the agreement. Courses eligible for one-to-one matching course transfer will be evaluated based on the comparability in content, quality, and rigor with SFBU's courses. Required courses require a closer comparability match. Courses eligible for topic area transfer may be mapped to the program's relevant topic area unit requirements without the need for one-to-one course matching and may have their units used to lieu of required units with the approval of the Registrar and School Dean. The transfer evaluation will include but is not limited to, course descriptions, course syllabi, and/or general public information. Students may be asked to provide course catalogs or syllabi if needed. Up to 75 units of courses that have been reviewed and currently approved as part of a formal SFBU articulation/transfer agreement are guaranteed to transfer.
  * When evaluating any foreign transcript, the admission evaluators may accept or transfer credit based on their knowledge of the course contents in comparison with similar courses offered in the U.S.
  * Without prior approval courses for transfer to SFBU may not be completed concurrently at another institution while a student is matriculated in an SFBU degree program.
  * College English courses taken at an institution where English is not an official language cannot be transferred for general education credit.
  * The credits under consideration for transfer must be earned at (1) institutions approved by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education, (2) public or private institutions of higher learning accredited by an accrediting association recognized by the U. S. Department of Education, or (3) foreign institutions of higher learning. Credits earned at a foreign institution degree must be evaluated by a member of National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES), Association of International Credential Evaluators (AICE), or American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO)'s International Education Services.
  * Professional Development Units (PDUs) offered by professional/industry organizations cannot be transferred to SFBU for academic credit.
  * Continuing Education Units (CEUs) offered on a non-academic basis by other academic institutions cannot be transferred to SFBU for academic credit.
  * The total credits transferred from other institutions to meet the student's undergraduate program requirements are limited to 75 semester units. Students must take at least 45 units at SFBU.
  * Credits transferred at the time of admission evaluation will reduce program length. Credit transferred from any outside institution has no effect on the calculation of the student's GPA or CGPA.
  * Credits transferred from any outside institution are excluded from the maximum attempted units for the program.
**Credits are transferred by the following conversion:**
  * **Definition of a Semester Unit:**
One semester credit hour equals, at a minimum, 15 contact classroom hours of
lecture, 30 contact hours of laboratory, or 45 contact hours of practicum.
  * **Conversion Factor:**
1 quarter unit = 0.66 semester unit
**Grades Required for Transfer Credit**
In the bachelor's degree programs, applicable courses completed with an
equivalency of a letter grade of "C" or better are transferable.  Courses
completed with Pass/No Pass are not transferable unless the transcript states
that the general grading policy is not based on letter grades. This policy
must be in writing from the institution (transcript key or a letter of
verification).
**Other Types of Undergraduate Transfer Credit**
The following other types of credit may be transferable:
  * **AP/IB course credit earned** which is considered to be equivalent to college credit.
  * **Credit by Examination - CLEP**
SFBU grants credit to those students who pass examinations in English, natural
sciences, humanities, and social science subjects offered by the College Level
Examination Program (CLEP). Only General Education credits will be granted.
Students should consult with the Admissions Office for information on
acceptable CLEP scores and units. **The CLEP Institution Code for SFBU is
7569.**
  * **Transfer of Credit from Defense Activity for Nontraditional Education Support (DANTES) and Military Services**
Credits will be allowed for DANTES Subject Standardized Tests and professional
military education evaluated by the American Council on Education (ACE). The
maximum transferable credits follow the same policies as specified above.
SFBU's evaluation of an application is made prior to the student's admission
to a program unless otherwise approved by the authorizing VA office. **The
DANTES Institution Code for SFBU is 9670.**
#### Graduate Transfer Credit
Graduate course credit earned at other accredited higher education
institutions may be transferable to meet the student's graduation requirements
if the courses are closely related to student's intended program of study and
the grade earned meets the requirement stated below. Such course credits are
considered qualified transfer credits. Credit transfer is made by the
admission evaluators while conducting the admission evaluation.
The following statements apply to qualified transfer credits:

### Tuberculosis (TB) Testing Requirements for All Incoming Students
As an incoming student, you must have Tuberculosis (TB) testing before
arriving on campus. The purpose is to keep the SFBU campus healthy and safe.
You must visit your primary care physician (doctor) or a clinician before
arriving at SFBU. Please print the following TB Risk Assessment and Clinical
Tuberculosis Assessment by Health Care Provider (ACHA Adapted TB Screening
Form):
  * [TB Risk Assessment and Clinical Tuberculosis Assessment by Health Care Provider (ACHA Adapted TB Screening Form) ](/sites/default/files/2022-01/TB_Assessment_Forms.pdf)
The first part of the form, "Tuberculosis (TB) Risk Assessment," must be
filled out by your medical provider. If your doctor answers "Yes" to any of
the questions, he/she must complete the second part of the form, "Clinical
Tuberculosis Assessment by Health Care Provider." Please upload the completed
form to your Student Portal. Also, please upload copies of laboratory reports
and chest x-rays, if any, with the completed form. If you don't do this, your
form will not be complete, and you will not be able to register for courses.
If you have questions, please see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) below.
If you still have a question, please email
[health@sfbu.edu](mailto:health@sfbu.edu).
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Q1: What if my doctor will not fill out this form?
Please ask your doctor strongly to fill out this form, and explain that your
university requires this form. At least, your doctor should provide his/her
own TB test form, together with your medical records.
Q2: What if I had a TB test done recently?
You must complete another TB test if you have not had a TB test done in the
month before the date of your acceptance to SFBU. If you have had a TB
evaluation done in the last month, please send the testing report to
[health@sfbu.edu](mailto:health@sfbu.edu). SSFBU will review the report to
decide if it is enough. Please do not send reports dated more than one month
before the date of your acceptance letter.
Q3: What if I cannot schedule a doctor's appointment in time before coming to
SFBU?
You will have to get your TB evaluation immediately when you arrive. The TB
evaluation takes one to two weeks to complete. You will not be able to
register for courses until you complete your TB evaluation.
Q4: If I was born in the United States and never left the country, or if I am
a permanent resident or U.S. citizen, do I still have to be tested?
Please have your doctor complete the "Tuberculosis (TB) Risk Assessment" form
to decide if you need to be tested.
### Meningococcal Facts
_According to California Health and Safety Code Section 120397, you are being
notified about the risks of meningococcal disease._
What you should know about meningococcal disease
  * It is a serious illness caused by bacteria that can infect the blood or areas around the brain and spinal cord. Infection can cause brain damage, disability, and quick death. Meningitis is the most common form of meningococcal disease. Common symptoms of meningitis include stiff neck, headache, and high fever.
  * Meningococcal vaccines can help prevent meningococcal disease. Check with your health care provider about meningococcal vaccines that you need.
How many people get the disease? Who is likely to get it?
  * Meningococcal disease is rare but serious. About 1,000 people in the U.S. get meningococcal disease each year. After babies, older adolescents (teens) and young adults have the highest rate of meningococcal disease. First-year college students living in dormitories are particularly at risk.
How serious is it?
  * About one in ten people who get meningococcal disease will die from it, even with treatment. Up to one in five people who survive will lose an arm or leg, become deaf, suffer brain damage, or have other problems.
How do Meningococcal Bacteria spread?
  * The bacteria are spread from person to person through air droplets. Close contact such as kissing, coughing, smoking, and living in crowded conditions (like dormitories) can increase the risk of getting the disease.
  * Overall, 5-10% of people in the U.S. have the meningococcal bacteria in their throat, but only a few of these people get sick. No one knows why some people get sick and others do not.
How can I protect myself?
  * You can protect yourself by: 
    * Not sharing items that have touched someone else's mouth, such as cups, bottles, cigarettes, lip balm, and spoons and forks;
    * Not smoking; and
    * Getting vaccinated against meningococcal disease.
  * Check with your health care provider about which meningococcal vaccines you need.
Which Meningococcal Vaccines Should I Get?
  * MCV4 vaccine protects against four deadly types of meningitis. If you have not received this vaccine since your 16th birthday, get it now.
  * MenB vaccine protects against the most common cause of bacterial meningitis among teens and young adults. In recent years, Men B outbreaks have happened at University of California Santa Barbara, the University of Oregon, and Princeton University. Ask your doctor if you should get this vaccine.

State law and University policy, does not discriminate on the basis of race,
color, national, and/or ethnic origin, sex, marital status, gender identity,
sexual orientation, pregnancy*, physical or mental disability, medical
condition (cancer related or genetic characteristics), ancestry, religion,
service in the uniformed services** , or age. SFBU also prohibits unlawful
harassment including sexual harassment and sexual violence. This policy of
non-discrimination applies to all aspects of admission, education, employment,
financial aid, student activities, and other school-administered programs.
SFBU is obligated to investigate all discrimination complaints, including
harassment in an unbiased, thorough manner.
Anyone with questions about SFBU's non-discrimination policy or complaints is
encouraged to contact the Legal Team at compliance@sfbu.edu.

** _Service in the uniformed services includes membership, application for

#### Student Grievance Policy and Procedure
SFBU takes grievances regarding the institution seriously. Students have the
right to file a grievance that concerns SFBU, whether such grievances are with
personnel, the course of study, general university policies, or other related
matters. This policy describes the grievance procedure available to students.
1) INFORMAL RESOLUTION
SFBU highly encourages students to attempt to informally resolve concerns
directly with the aggrieving party or department. Students are particularly
encouraged to informally resolve academic matters, such as those involving
course policies, with their instructor, or, if their instructor is not
available, with their respective dean, prior to filing a grievance. Grade
appeals may be made as described in the section of this catalog entitled
"Grading Policy and Academic Standards."
Even after initiating the formal grievance process, students are encouraged to
seek informal resolution of their concerns. A student whose concerns are
resolved may withdraw a formal grievance at any point in the process.
With regard to appeals of disciplinary action and all other grievances,
including those related to harassment and discrimination, no student is
obligated to attempt informal resolution and may bring a formal grievance to
the administration as outlined in this policy.
2) TIMING
Academic grievances and appeals of disciplinary action must be received by the
administration within 30 days of the close of the academic term in which the
first incident giving rise to the grievance occurred or the notice date of the
disciplinary action.
There is no deadline for other types of complaints.
3) GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE AND RESOLUTION
All grievances and supporting documentation shall be submitted in writing to
the SFBU Compliance Department. The grievance should be made using the [SFBU
Grievance Form](/sites/default/files/2022-01/GrievanceForm.pdf), which is
available on the SFBU website.
Please note that if a grievance is being filed in order to appeal disciplinary
action, the grievance must include a description of the basis of appeal.
Failure to state the basis of the appeal in the initial grievance may result
in denial of the appeal. The following are the only valid bases of appeal:
  * new evidence which could reasonably be expected to cause the individual(s) reviewing the grievance to overrule prior disciplinary action,
  * failure to follow published SFBU policies in a way that materially disadvantaged the student;
  * demonstrated bias or discrimination and (iv) the sanction imposed is substantially disproportionate to the severity of the violation.
The grievance may be sent via email to student-affairs@sfbu.edu or delivered
in person to the front desk of the SFBU Administrative Building during normal
business hours. If the grievance is regarding SFBU Compliance or its
personnel, then the grievance may be sent to the Assistant Vice President for
Student Affairs via in person delivery to the front desk of the SFBU
Administrative Building during normal business hours. In such case,
complainant should specify that the grievance is regarding compliance or its
personnel. Intake personnel, generally a member of SFBU Compliance, will
review the form. If the form is complete, intake personnel will, within 5
business days of receipt, acknowledge receipt of the grievance and forward it
to the appropriate party for review and resolution. Matters are generally
forwarded as follows:
  * Academic matters are forwarded to the Chief Academic Officer, or the Chief Academic Officer's designee.
  * Appeals of disciplinary action are forwarded to the Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs, or the Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs's designee.
  * All other complaints are assigned to a member of SFBU Compliance.
Depending upon the type and complexity of the grievance, the appropriate party
may, in their discretion, adjudicate the matter or assign the matter to a
Grievance committee.
Within 60 days of receipt of the grievance, SFBU shall provide a written
response to the grievance via email. If further investigation is needed, the
complainant will be provided with a written response to the grievance within
10 business days after completion of the investigation.
The complainant may appeal SFBU's resolution by filing a statement of appeal
that clearly describes the basis of appeal within 5 business days of the date
of the written response. The President of SFBU, or the President's designee,
shall adjudicate the appeal within 30 days of SFBU's receipt of complainant's
statement of appeal.
If a complainant has exhausted all grievance procedures provided under SFBU's
policies, the complainant may contact:
The WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC), 1080 Marina Village
Parkway, Suite 500, Alameda, CA 94501, 510.748.9001.
4) NO RETALIATION
No member of the SFBU community shall be subject to adverse action by SFBU
based upon the reasonable good faith filing or participation in a grievance.
5) MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS
Records for student complaints are maintained for at least 6 years. Records
for grievances made by non-students are maintained in accordance with
applicable university policy.
#### Reasonable Accommodation for Students with Disabilities
SFBU adheres to the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements and
health impairments and other documented conditions.
Students who wish to discuss the availability of services for people with
physical disabilities or temporary disabilities, or who wish to report barrier
problems, should contact the Director of Counseling and Career Services.
#### Academic Freedom Policy
Academic freedom includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the right to
free inquiry, expression, and discussion. Faculty are members of a learned
profession and stewards of this educational institution. When they speak or
write as citizens, they should be free from institutional censorship or
discipline. As educators, they should remember that the public may judge their
profession and their institution by their utterances. SFBU will not retaliate
against faculty members for sharing their convictions and responsible
conclusions with their colleagues and students in their teaching and writing;
however, faculty should not incorporate controversial matter that has no
relation to their subject into their teaching. Faculty members are not
authorized to engage in offensive speech such as hate speech or sexual
harassment.
#### Credit Hour Policy
SFBU follows federal guidelines regarding credit hours.
Pursuant to 34 C.F.R. SS600.2, a credit hour is an amount of work represented
in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement
that is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably
approximates not less than -
  * **1)** One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or semester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one-quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or
  * **2)** At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.
**The above shall apply to both in-person and distance education modalities.**
One hour of classroom = One contact hour
One contact hour = 50 minutes of instruction
#### Transfer of Credit from Other Institutions
**Undergraduate Transfer Credit**
conducting the admission evaluation or by formal transfer agreement between
institutions. The transfer of credit is done at the program-of-study level,
topic area level, the major and major selectable levels and on a case-by-case
basis. The following statements apply to all transfer credits:
  * Courses eligible for transfer by prearranged transfer / articulation agreement shall follow the details contained in the agreement. Courses eligible for one-to-one matching course transfer will be evaluated based on the comparability in content, quality and rigor with SFBU's courses. Required courses require a closer comparability match. Courses eligible for topic area transfer may be mapped to the program's relevant topic area unit requirements without the need for one-to-one course matching and may have their units used to lieu of required units with the approval of the Registrar and School Dean. The transfer evaluation will include, but is not limited to, course descriptions, course syllabi, and/or general public information. Students may be asked to provide course catalogs or syllabi if needed. Up to 75 semester units of courses that have been reviewed and currently approved as part of a formal SFBU articulation/transfer agreement are guaranteed to transfer.
**Graduate Transfer Credit**
if the courses are closely related to the engineering course requirements in
the student's intended program of study and the grade earned meets the
requirement stated below. Such course credits are considered qualified
transfer credits. Credit transfer is made by the admission evaluators while
conducting the admission evaluation.

Cryptocurrency was created to remove the middle entity when people
send/receive money and was designed for the "unbanked" people to gain access
to the financial systems; there are almost a billion people who lack access to
banking systems. In this course, you will learn the dynamics of Cryptocurrency
including the leading crypto coins, Bitcoin and Ethereum. You will be studying
the benefits and risks of using cryptocurrency. NFT (Non-Fungible Token) will
be discussed as a concept and as a business vehicle. The course also
illustrates how NFTs can be used to represent items such as photos, videos,
audio, and other types of digital files as unique items, and use Blockchain
technology to generate a verified proof of ownership. Another topic covered is
DeFi (Decentralized finance) which is a Blockchain-based form of finance that
does not rely on central financial entities like banks to offer traditional
financial services, making it more secure. In addition, the course also
explains Blockchain Technology and its applications. By the end of this
course, students will have a good knowledge of Cryptocurrency, NFT, DeFi, and
Blockchain Technology and the impact of such technologies on the future of
finance and more.

The term Metaverse is a hot topic of conversation recently, with many tech
giants like Facebook and Microsoft staking claims. Author Neal Stephenson is
credited with coining the term "metaverse" in his 1992 science fiction novel
"Snow Crash," in which he envisioned lifelike avatars who live in realistic 3D
buildings and other virtual reality environments. Since then, various
developments have reached milestones on the way toward a real Metaverse: an
online virtual world which incorporates augmented reality (AR), virtual
reality (VR), 3D holographic avatars, video, and other means of communication.
As the Metaverse expands, it will offer a hyper-real alternative world or what
comic fans call a parallel universe. After this course, you will be able to
answer the question, "What is the Metaverse?" We will discuss the
relationships between the Metaverse and blockchain, cryptocurrency, and NFTs.
Real-life applications will be presented, and the future of the Metaverse will
be explored.
_No prerequisites or coding experience is required._

#  Transportation
Transportation in the San Francisco Bay Area as well as in the U.S. in general
can be surprising for people who come from countries with convenient,
dependable, and modern public transportation systems. In contrast to residents
of Asian and European cities, the majority of people in the U.S. tend to use
private instead of public transportation, particularly automobiles. As a
result, using a bus, train, taxi, or bicycle may be more challenging, and you
may find fewer choices. Prices may be higher, services may not run all night,
and the time between buses and trains may be longer. Except in big cities,
taxis must be arranged by calling a taxi company, and the costs are
considerably higher than for service within a big city.
This page contains links which can help you learn about various options for
transportation during your time at SFBU. Students attending colleges and
universities in the Bay Area have access to a wide array of transportation
options.
#### Airport to Fremont
Various modes of transportation can get you to San Francisco Bay University
from any of the three area airports. Some transportation services are listed
below, but many other options are available. Please coordinate your
transportation by contacting the following companies or other services.
  * Lyft, available via app
  * Uber, available via app
  * [Merit Taxi (650) 571-0606 ](https://www.yelp.com/biz/merit-taxi-san-mateo?osq=taxi)
  * [Charity Cab (925) 353-5357 ](https://www.yelp.com/biz/charity-cab-pleasanton?osq=taxi)
  * [Fremont Jet Cab (510) 300-5777 ](https://www.yelp.com/biz/fremont-jet-cab-fremont-2?osq=taxi)
  * [Yellow Smart Cab (650) 966-6000 ](https://www.yelp.com/biz/yellow-smart-cab-palo-alto?osq=taxi)
  * [San Jose Airport Taxi (408) 600-6352](https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-jose-airport-taxi-san-jose?osq=taxi)
San Francisco Airport has zones for taxis at the center islands of its
roadways. However, some taxis do not go to Fremont. For this reason, arranging
transportation ahead of time is the best way to make sure that you arrive in
Fremont as planned.
SFBU is not affiliated with any company listed above; therefore, it cannot be
held liable or responsible for any acts or behaviors of either the drivers or
the businesses.
#  SFBU-AC Transit EasyPass Program
![EasyPass - SFBU Cover ](/sites/default/files/2022-05/EasyPassCover.jpeg)
All full-time San Francisco Bay University (SFBU) students are eligible for
the AC Transit SFBU EasyPass - the annual bus pass that allows students to go
anywhere AC Transit goes - anytime!
EasyPass is great for your campus community, the environment, and your
checkbook. The popular student benefit provides for an awesome discount.
Compared to driving or purchasing your own transit passes, having an EasyPass
can save you thousands of dollars a year, freeing up money for books, tuition,
or anything else. Whether you use your EasyPass as back up transportation or
use it every day, students can save big with EasyPass.
Passes are distributed to eligible students who have registered and signed the
Pass Acceptance Form. The program uses the Clipper fare card with Photo ID.
Your first EasyPass card will be available for pick-up at the San Francisco
Bay University Administration Office usually at the start of the first
semester you qualify.
Full-time eligible students who attend all three semesters (Summer, Fall and
Spring) will have an active SFBU EasyPass all year long. SFBU's EasyPass will
be automatically loaded onto your original EasyPass card every semester that
you qualify, so keep your card long-term.
#### For questions about eligibility, contact the SFBU EasyPass Site
Coordinator
at Room 127 at 161 Mission Falls Ln, Fremont, CA, 94539. Hours: Monday-Friday,
9:00 A.M. - 5:30 P.M. You can also email
[easypass@sfbu.edu](mailto:easypass@sfbu.edu).
#### SFBU EasyPass Rules:
  * The Pass is valid on all AC Transit buses (local and transbay). The SFBU EasyPass is not valid on the Dumbarton Express (use Line U instead).
  * All Pass holders must tag their EasyPass on the Clipper card reader upon entering an AC Transit bus.
  * The Pass is valid only for the dates shown in your EasyPass welcome letter.
  * The Pass is not transferable or refundable, and will be revoked if used by anyone else; your card must be presented to AC Transit personnel for inspection upon request. AC Transit personnel have the right to confiscate your Clipper card if they feel the EasyPass is being used fraudulently.
  * Any attempt to transfer or sell the Pass may result in criminal charges; a fine of up to $250 (or community service) can be imposed for the misuse of your Pass with the intent to evade the payment of fares (California Penal Code 640). San Francisco Bay University may impose additional penalties.
#### Still Have Questions? For Check out the following publications:

Join San Francisco Bay University's Summer 2022 Speaker Series with our
featured speaker, Ashley Weerpass presenting "Transitioning from College to a
Career".
#### Presentation Summary:
Our lives are filled with goals, decisions, plans, and execution. You made an
excellent decision to invest in yourself and your future by going to and
completing college. College while difficult is simple since often once a field
is chosen the curriculum and pace are well defined. Choosing a career and
navigating 30 to 40 years of gainful employment is less straightforward.
Today's graduates find themselves navigating a myriad of options. Our world is
a global village and opportunities exist in more than one country. Income can
be derived from a variety of means, self-employment, employee, gig-worker, and
hybrid work.
Key ongoing questions are:
  * What job is best for me?
  * What are my strengths?
  * What is my life plan for each phase of my life?
  * What will make me happy? Is success equal to happiness?

We wonder how others become successful. What's the secret? We often say
"He/she had an 'edge' ". We can't quite put our fingers on it but we know it
when we see it. Do you have that "something" that "edge"? Success in the
workplace means striking a balance between achieving superb results and
working well with others. Organizations promote teamwork; however, they still
reward personal achievement. In order to be recognized, promoted and receive
bonuses, you must maintain a competitive advantage. Do you have that "edge"?
What is it, and how do you get it. If you have it, how do you keep it or keep
it sharp?
This presentation is about how developing your emotional intelligence could be
your competitive advantage, your "edge". It also offers tips, suggestions and
strategies.

The COVID-19 pandemic is the ultimate catalyst for digital transformation and
will greatly accelerate several major trends that were already well underway
before the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic will have a lasting effect not only
on our economy, but on how we go about our daily lives, and things are not
likely to return to pre-pandemic norms. While this pandemic has forced many
businesses to reduce or suspend operations, affecting their bottom line, it
has helped to accelerate the development of several emerging technologies.
This is especially true for innovations that reduce human-to-human contact,
automate processes, and increase productivity amid social distancing.

### Michael Tang
### Master's in Electrical Engineering
When Michael Tang first went to San Francisco Bay University, he had no idea
he'd end up working there, starting his own company and eventually joining
another startup that went public for big bucks.
After graduating with a master's degree in electrical engineering, Tang worked
at SFBU as the deputy director for admissions and director of placement. He
would market the university to students and help them with internship and job
opportunities.
He was attracted to the university because past President George Hsieh was his
mentor. Tang was accepted to various institutions, but it was Hsieh's seminar
on Emotional Quotient and Intelligence Quotient that motivated him to attend
SFBU in the heart of Silicon Valley.
"The education here I think inspires people to push their curiosity to the
next level, especially in technology," Tang said. "Because we are at such a
crossroads of humanity and technology and design here, I got exposed to all
the company cultures in the area and was inspired to study."
"And I think, as a student, the drive to know more will eventually push you to
explore deeper in the subject that you are interested in, which is the most
important thing. It's not the knowledge itself. It's that motivation behind
that, to push us students to explore more."
His advice to students is to make as many connections as possible. While
working at SFBU after graduation, he was hosting a short-term rental and had
the opportunity to meet all sorts of people. By chance, a businessman named
David Kanel stayed over, and the relationship changed his life. The two of
them started working together with other founding team members and raised
money for the startup Boxc Logistics, launching Tang's career to further
heights.
From there, Tang joined mobile e-commerce marketplace Wish and helped build up
its logistic infrastructure and system. It went public in 2020, and the father
of two daughters is still excitedly constructing logistic solutions for the
next generation of e-commerce.
"If you have connections, you can connect technology, you can connect people,
then you're halfway through success," Tang said. "It's all about connecting
dots and believing in yourself and taking a leap of faith. Sometimes you don't
know what's going to be happening ahead of you. You just need to trust that
it's going to be great."

# Agreements, Transfer Guides and Memorandums of Understanding
  * ### Articulation and Transfer Agreements with Community Colleges in California
San Francisco Bay University has entered into articulation agreements with
multiple community colleges, which enable a smoother transfer of credits to
SFBU and can shorten the time required for students to earn a Bachelor of
Science in Business Administration (BSBA) or a Bachelor of Science in Computer
Science (BSCS). Further, the agreements clarify which courses map to required
undergraduate General Education (GE) and major courses.
For more information on transfer credits from colleges in the bay area or
otherwise, prospective community college students should talk to their college
counselors and the [ SFBU admissions team](mailto:admissions@sfbu.edu) about

#  CPT, OPT and On-Campus Employment
Curricular Practical Training (CPT)
CPT involves cooperative education, internships, work/study arrangements, or
other types of practicum provided through employers, in agreement with San
Francisco Bay University. Students should review the CPT Process Guide for the
latest information about these exciting opportunities.
[CPT Process Guide](/student-life/workstudy/cpt)
Optional Practical Training (OPT) for International Students
With OPT, international students with F-1 status for two consecutive semesters
who plan on working in the United States within their current field of study
can receive work authorizations. Designated advisors at SFBU recommend
students for OPT. However, the final approvals go through the U.S. Citizenship
and Immigration Service (USCIS). Students interested in the OPT process should
log into their SFBU student portal to review the related OPT requirements.
[Student Portal Login](https://my.sfbu.edu/Account/Logon?userType=Student)
Job Opportunities with SFBU

opportunities are within the administrative, instructional, and facilities
management departments at SFBU. They are part-time roles available as needed,
and are open to qualified students. Students should go to the eCareer Center
Job Board on their SFBU student portal account to find available positions.
[SFBU Portal Login](https://my.sfbu.edu/Account/Logon?userType=Student)
#  Curricular Practical Training (CPT)
#### Good to Know About CPT at SFBU:
CPT is both a course and a job which helps prepare you as a professional.
There are no restrictions on what you may earn on the job; however, the focus
of the training is to allow the student real-world professional practice as
part of a course. The curricular practicum must provide students with a
valuable learning experience and must significantly increase their knowledge
in their program of study.
#### Applying for CPT
F-1 students are eligible for CPT after completing 2 full-time semesters at
SFBU. The deadline to apply for CPT is Week 11 of the working period. e.g. if
you are interested in taking CPT during the Spring 2024 semester, the deadline
to submit the application is Week 11 of Spring 2024.
You can submit the application on your student portal under My Requests ->
Academic Requests -> CPT Application.
#### Start and End Dates
You may begin your CPT during the semester break prior to the start of the
semester or at any time during the semester's first twelve (12) weeks. Your
end date must be the last day of the semester.
#### Continuing CPT
If you plan to continue with the same job, you will need to register for a new
CPT course in the next semester by completing a new request and following the
process again. Apply early so there is no interruption.
#### Semester Break
Students who are on a complete semester break will have to pay a registration
fee, learning resource fee, campus fee, and an insurance fee as well as the
CPT course tuition fee.
#### Social Security Card
If you do not have a social security number (SSN), the CPT advisor will
provide you with a letter in support of your SSN. This letter is issued by a
Designated School Official (DSO) upon approval of your CPT. You will need to
apply for an SSN at a local Social Security Administration office.
#### Optional Practical Training (OPT)
Please be aware that if you wish to take OPT after you graduate, you must not
take more than 12 months of full-time CPT at your current academic level
(undergraduate or graduate). There are no restrictions on OPT eligibility for
part-time CPT.
#### Frequently Asked Questions
#### Do I qualify for CPT if I transferred from another institution in the
United States?
Students who have studied at another institution for a period of time
preceding him/her joining SFBU can have that period be counted towards their
CPT eligibility. The degree program from the previous institution must match
the current program at SFBU. ex. You are transferring from another US
institution for an MBA and enrolling at SFBU for an MBA. Simply ensure that
you meet all the requirements. (Refer to Step 1)
#### What if I am currently working on changing my Visa status, such as H4 to
F1?
You can apply for CPT upon receiving your F1 status. Simply ensure you meet
all the requirements. (Refer to Step 1)
#### I am a U. S. Citizen (or legal permanent resident), can I take CPT?
Yes, you are eligible for CPT and are able to take CPT immediately.
#### What if my employers' corporate office is outside of California?
Students are allowed to participate in internships that are in-person and
remote within the U.S.
#### How many times can I enroll in CPT?
No more than 6 units of practicum coursework may be counted towards
#### Will my reports be graded?
Reports will be graded on a Satisfactory (S)/No Pass (NP) basis. Reports that
are incomplete or submitted late have the consequence of receiving a NP grade.
If a student receives two NP grades, their CPT will be terminated and they
will receive a failing grade in the course. Students who fail CPT will not
receive future opportunities to participate in CPT again.
#### I am authorized for CPT, but what do I do if I change my mind, change my
visa status or something about my job changes?
For any changes in your CPT, you must notify the CPT Advisor immediately. If
you're an international student, the CPT Advisor may have to amend or cancel
your CPT I-20.

](/sites/default/files/2022-07/avery_niou_spotlight.jpeg)
**_Avery Niou  
Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) 2022 _**
Avery Niou graduated from San Francisco Bay University with her Master of
Science in Computer Science (MSCS) this past spring. Avery is multilingual:
she speaks Mandarin, Taiwanese, English, and a bit of Japanese.
Avery was born and raised in Taiwan, but relocated to the San Francisco Bay
Area two years ago. When speaking of the greatest challenge she has overcome
thus far, Avery said, "I left my comfort zone where I grew up and a company I
worked for six years. I decided to move to Silicon Valley without any family
or friends, to pursue my dreams."
When a friend of Avery's landed a great position at a Silicon Valley company
after earning a degree from San Francisco Bay University, she knew she would
pursue her master's degree in Computer Science at SFBU. When asked what she
enjoyed most about her experience while attending SFBU, Avery stated, "SFBU is
a job hunting-oriented learning environment; new courses are constantly added
to the curriculum based on the job market and current industry trends."
Avery started her journey at SFBU with a passion for front-end software
development, but hadn't yet obtained the knowledge and skills needed for the
workforce. While taking a Computer Science course with Dr. Ken Cheung,
JavaScript and Internet Programming, Avery's knowledge grew in this subject,
pushing her further towards her goal of becoming a software engineer: "The
projects from this course taught me so much. I was able to add them to my
resume." Other subjects that Avery studied during her time at SFBU include big
data, cloud computing, and machine learning.
After earning her degree at San Francisco Bay University, Avery landed a job
at PlayStation as a software engineer. When asked her definition of success,
Avery stated, "I think success happens often, every time you achieve a small
goal that is a success. Little successes accumulate to your life story."
Avery's future goals include becoming a senior software engineer, exploring
her passion further for front-end development, and enhancing her DevOps
skills.
Congratulations and best wishes to Avery! Thank you for sharing your story
with the San Francisco Bay University community.

#  Student Spotlight: Julio Camacho
![Julio Camacho Profile Picture with Master of Business Administration program
degree at San Francisco Bay University](/sites/default/files/2022-10/julio-
camacho-teaser.jpeg)
##### Julio Camacho
##### Master of Business Administration program
This is San Francisco Bay University student Julio Camacho. Julio is a 2022
President's Scholarship recipient working towards his Master of Business
Administration (MBA) degree and is just starting his journey at SFBU this
semester (Fall 2022).
Julio was born and raised in Guadalajara, Mexico, where he earned his B.A. in
International Relations. Growing up, Julio was not drawn to jobs most kids
wanted, such as working as a police officer or a firefighter. Instead, he was
interested in careers such as architecture and graphic design. While earning
his B.A. degree, Julio had the opportunity to study abroad temporarily in
Santiago, Chile. He loved his time there so much that he decided to move back
to Santiago after graduating to get more professional experience. Then, he
began to focus on becoming a private sector development expert through
business strategies that can help strengthen small and medium enterprises
(SMEs) and foster local entrepreneurship through innovation and data-driven
approaches.
Julio describes himself as a passionate person who is curious by nature, likes
to be around people who can teach him things, and appreciates learning
different points of view. With many experiences under his belt, Julio often
follows his heart and likes to take risks. His greatest challenge to date has
been moving to the U.S. to pursue his MBA at San Francisco Bay University.
While adjusting to life in San Francisco, he has realized that there are many
cultural differences between the U.S. and Mexico, and he sometimes misses his
family and friends. In fact, it was never in his plans to study in the U.S.
Julio explains, "When the opportunity came to my door, I was scared but
curious, and I thought, 'What if I can make it? Maybe there is a chance for me
here.' There were doubts, but here I am! It's been challenging, but it's a
great opportunity."
#### _"What if I can make it? Maybe there is a chance for me here."_
Julio lives in San Francisco and commutes to SFBU by BART. He likes to use his
commute time to study and catch up on reading, which is one of his favorite
hobbies: "I like reading novels by Mexican and Latin authors that address
social issues and real things happening in this world. Hurricane Season by
Fernanda Melchor is a book he recommends for everyone to read in order to
understand one of the many issues of contemporary Mexico. Julio explains, "It
captures the level of violence and machismo culture through the lens of people
who are suffering injustices such as inequality, poverty, and corruption. It
is a novel that has really stuck with me."
When asked about his proudest moment, Julio had two in mind. The first was
receiving the President's Scholarship from SFBU. He had never received a
scholarship before, and was honored by the opportunity provided by SFBU. The
second was a professional moment while working as a project analyst at a
Mexican startup last year. Julio worked on finding grants and entering startup
competitions to help the company grow; his efforts helped the company to
receive grants from different organizations: SingularityU Mexico, Google for
Startups, and AT&T Mexico.
San Francisco Bay University was recommended to Julio by his partner, who also
recommended California State University, Northridge. Julio ultimately decided
on SFBU because he was drawn to San Francisco: it is one of the world's most
innovative, enterprising, and diverse cities; it is walkable; and the Bay Area
has good public transportation. Lastly, he chose SFBU because he received the
President's Scholarship.
While attending San Francisco Bay University, Julio is looking forward to
gaining knowledge and work experience, which he will compare to his work
experience in Mexico. Julio is interested in learning more about the startup
environment in San Francisco and will focus on finding an internship there
while studying.
When asked what he enjoys most about SFBU so far, Julio said, "I really like
the diverse community and how the students are from all different parts of the
world, and I think that is the most interesting part... the sharing of
experiences and perspectives is very rich." In addition, Julio also likes the
small classroom size because it is easier to get to know his classmates and
professors: "The best part is sharing conversations with classmates about
different foods and the current political state in our home countries. There's
always something new and always something to learn from one another."
#### _"There's always something new and always something to learn from one
another."_
After graduating from San Francisco Bay University, Julio would like to gain
work experience in the U.S. because that would be extremely valuable when he
returns to Mexico. He wants to pursue his dream career as a private sector
development consultant, and help small and medium businesses in Mexico become
more innovative and competitive.
In addition to his studies, Julio enjoys traveling, reading, listening to
music and podcasts, cooking healthy foods and desserts, and biking. He even
spent the New Year in Brazil with friends! When asked what he likes best about
the Bay Area, Julio said, "It's very diverse; not a day goes by where I don't
hear a foreign accent and Spanish, for example. There are great things to do:
museums, libraries, and food experiences."
Julio shared that an English teacher he had in Mexico greatly influenced him
on a personal level: "He had an interesting perspective on life, and planted
the seed that made me want to leave Mexico to explore and have this
international experience. He influenced me to keep studying and earn an MBA.
He introduced me to the music I listen to, and the political and social issues
we talked about influenced me, as well. We still keep in touch."
Julio advises current and prospective SFBU students to "come with an open mind
and embrace the opportunity. Get out of your comfort zone, because this is
what this experience is all about! Broaden your horizons, meet new people,
have an opportunistic attitude, and learn something. Be curious, ask
questions, and go deeper into topics. To question and see different
perspectives is part of the learning process."
#### _"To question and see different perspectives is part of the learning
process."_
Congratulations and best wishes, Julio, throughout your journey at SFBU and
beyond. Thank you for being such an inspiration to the San Francisco Bay
University community!

Cover Letters
Cover letters are your opportunity to introduce yourself to an employer and
allow you to express what makes you the best fit for a particular position.
For this reason, sending a cover letter is a good idea even when the employer
states that it is not needed. Further advice and exemplar cover letters can be

Networking
The following are useful pointers to help you create and maintain a network,
which is important in finding the ideal job.
**Establishing your network:** Assess the network that you already have first.
You may have more connections than you realize.
  * Focus on quality as opposed to quantity
  * Practice a 30-second pitch
  * Listen actively
  * Take notes
  * Follow up
  * Return favors
**Maintaining your network:** After developing your network, maintaining it is
critical, even after you find work. You may not require help from your network
right away, but it could be useful when you don't expect it. The following
tips will help your professional connections stay strong:
_Here are some easy steps to keep your professional relationships strong:_
  * **Use social networks actively:** share industry-related articles on LinkedIn weekly, if possible. Send information that you think would interest a particular connection straight to that person, along with a short message. Also, post career updates regularly so that your connections are aware of developments in your career.
  * **Maintain a close small network:** determine who your most valuable contacts are, and interact with them via email or phone call a few times each year to ask what is going on with them in their careers and in general. These personal communications are more significant than posts on social media, which is best suited for maintaining contact with more distant connections. If nothing else, you have something important in common with them; you've both received a top-notch education from a San Francisco Bay area university. Networking is easier when you focus on points of common interest.
  * **Help your contacts:** whenever you believe that one of your connections may be able to help another, suggest that they connect with each other. This effort will demonstrate to both of your connections that their success is important to you, and they may be more likely to think about you when opportunities arise in the future.

Interviewing
_How to Answer the 'Why Do You Want to Work for Us?' Interview Question_
Source: [ https://www.vault.com/blogs/interviewing/how-to-answer-the-why-do-
you-want-to-work-for-us-interview-question
](https://www.vault.com/blogs/interviewing/how-to-answer-the-why-do-you-want-
to-work-for-us-interview-question)
One of the more common interview questions these days, especially for entry-
level positions, is some form of "Why do you want to work for us?" Other forms
of this question include "What attracts you to our firm?" and "What about our
firm excites you?" Whatever the exact phrasing you receive, there are a few
things you want to get across as clearly and concisely as possible when
answering. San Francisco Bay University should help you answer these questions
in the following ways:
#### 1\. You know a lot about the firm; you've done your research.
One of the things this question aims to do is gauge how well you prepare
yourself for meetings and work situations. Will you do the prep work? Will you
take the time to be extremely knowledgeable before showing up? Note that it's
not too difficult and doesn't take too much to do some basic research about a
company. All the information you need is a Google search away. So make sure to
look at the company's website, look at their products and/or services, read
about their leaders and team, make sure you understand their place in the
market and their strategy. Also read their press releases and about any awards
and honors they've received. And then do some reading outside their site.
Check out their Wiki page, read some news articles about them. And while you
do your research, take notes of the things that genuinely excite and impress
you. Then, when you're done researching (maybe an hour at most is fine), take
a look at your notes and choose three things to mention in your interview.
Ideally, you'll practice, either aloud or just in your mind, how you might get
these three things across clearly and concisely in your interview.
#### 2\. You're very enthusiastic about the prospect of working there.
While you answer this question, keep in mind that interviewers are gauging
your excitement level of working for them. They want candidates who are
extremely enthusiastic, since that enthusiasm for the company and their work
will more often than not turn into good work being done if you're hired. If
you're not enthusiastic, or don't show that you are, then interviewers will
view you as someone who might be a deadbeat, downer type of employee, meaning
a low performer. Companies want upbeat, enthusiastic people on their teams.
They want people excited about their strategy, mission, products, and
services. So when answering this question, make sure your interviewers
understand that all of the things you know about their company truly excite
you, and that you'd be thrilled to join them and their mission and help them
reach their goals.
#### 3\. Your skills, experience, and goals are a good fit for the role and
company.
Speaking of goals, interviewers know that, like companies, individuals also
have them. And interviewers are looking for candidates whose goals match up
with the company's. They want someone whose career goals will be a good fit
for the specific role and for the company as a whole. So, when you're
researching the role (you will, of course, know the job description backwards
and forwards before you interview) and the company, you want to take note of
the things that mesh with your goals. For example, if you want to get involved
in a certain sector, and the company is involved in that, then you want to
point that out to your interviewer. Or, say, if one of your goals/desires is
to manage more and more people and so working for a high growth company whose
team is growing is important to you, then get that across. Other things that
might mesh with your career goals include working for a certain size of firm
(big, small, startup, etc.), working for a firm with a certain geographic
reach (international, a specific U.S. region, etc.), working in a certain type
of culture (open, transparent, collaborative, etc.). Whatever the case might
be, get as specific as possible, and spell out that what you're looking to do
and learn at this point in your career is a good fit for the specific role and
firm. Of course, be honest. Don't force yourself into a role or company that
won't be a good fit for you. Never forget that interviewing is a two-way
street: you're interviewing the company as much as they're interviewing you.

### Afrin Patni
### Master of Business Administration program
Afrin Patni is following her American dream.
Originally from Mumbai, India, Patni is studying at San Francisco Bay
University to pursue a career in technology. While she knows her bachelor's
degrees in sociology and education aren't traditional for the field, she is
working on her master's in business administration at SFBU to help her jump
into the industry.
"It was my dream to come here and study in America," Patni said.
The university's location is one of the main reasons Patni enrolled. Its
proximity to San Francisco, Silicon Valley and companies such as Google, Zoom
and Tesla was enticing to her. She also loves the mountain views, weather and
hiking that she didn't experience in India.
Patni credits her stellar education to SFBU's small class sizes and personal
relationships with teachers. She receives not only advice on her studies and
career path, but for her personal life, as well.
"SFBU is not just about textbooks and lectures, it is preparing us for our
future," Patni said. "It's working on our soft skills. I know that when I
graduate from SFBU, I'll get good opportunities where I can apply my skills
and excel in my career to achieve great things."
The university understands the importance of a proper work-life balance. There
are clubs like Toastmasters International to improve one's public speaking and
leadership prowess, but there are also video game consoles ready to provide
relief from stress. Outside of class, Patni can be found playing ping pong and
board games.
Above all, Patni is proud to be a part of the SFBU community.
"This place feels like home, and I know that I have a bright future."  
#  Student Spotlight: John Odebode
![John Odebode Profile Picture with Master of Business Administration program
odebode-teaser.jpeg)
##### John Odebode
This is San Francisco Bay University student John Odebode. John has just
completed his final trimester at SFBU, and will be graduating with his Master
of Business Administration (MBA) degree at the upcoming ceremony happening in
May.
Having grown up in Nigeria, John pursued a Bachelor's and Master's degree in
Philosophy at the University of Lagos, and later landed a job in Supply Chain
with ExxonMobil. His six years of experience in the field motivated him to
pursue an MBA, which landed him at San Francisco Bay University.
"It took me securing a graduate internship at ExxonMobil in 2016 to have a
sense of direction on where exactly I was headed. I had the opportunity to
work in the procurement department at ExxonMobil, Nigeria, which opened me up
to a world of possibilities in the business space. Ever since then, I picked
up interest in supply chain management-that has been the lane for me."
Although he misses them dearly, John's parents, three brothers, and one
sister, who reside in Nigeria, continue to support his aspirations of pursuing
education and a career. Apart from his academic and professional pursuits,
John likes to play soccer and actively participates in a local league in Santa
Clara.
In his search for an MBA program that aligned with his specific goals, John
found SFBU to be an ideal choice due to its curriculum. Furthermore, he was
fortunate enough to receive a scholarship to support his studies. John also
recognized the benefits of the smaller class sizes at SFBU, as they allowed
him to build closer relationships with his professors and customize his
education to suit his unique experiences and career aspirations. Small classes
create a more personalized learning experience. John noted that "There's a lot
of innovation happening in this environment, and the prospect of being a part
of it was a deciding factor in why I chose SFBU."
What John likes most about SFBU is "the people! The professors and staff
members have a sincere interest in my success, and I speak for all students
when I say there is a sense of commitment for professors and staff to
contribute positively to our lives and support our dreams."
When asked about his proudest moment, John said, "I've had a lot, and there
will be more to come, but I've had the privilege to connect with many
prospective students and see them transition to current SFBU students
reporting to campus. It gives me a lot of joy knowing that I helped them
through their decision-making process."
The Capstone Project holds a special place in John's mind, as it is designed
to encapsulate all the knowledge he has gained in the MBA program thus far,
and utilize it to create a comprehensive business plan. John's project was a
business plan for Maestro 360, a sports management company.
For John, the best part about going to school here is "the diversity of the
environment: there are people from all walks of life, ethnic groups, and
cultures, and it has been a great experience connecting with all these people.
I've learned so much about other cultures and perspectives on life."
As a participant in SFBU's Curricular Practical Training (CPT) program, John
had the opportunity to intern while studying. He secured an internship with
Cummins Inc. through CPT and was determined to excel in his role, striving to
meet and exceed his manager's expectations while balancing his academic
workload. This experience taught John the value of time management and to
maximize his productivity. His hard work paid off, and he was eventually
offered a full-time position at the end of his internship. John will return to
Cummins Inc. in June in the role of Value Package Introduction (VPI)
Integrator, Technical Sourcing, and Cost Management. John explains, "The value
I have gotten from SFBU is beyond paying them to provide a service. I have
gotten much more than what I have paid for."
When asked about the individuals who have had an impact on his life, several
people come to John's mind. His father's strong sense of responsibility has
played a significant role in shaping him into the person he is today.
Moreover, Mr. Dele-Ijagbulu Folu, his manager at ExxonMobil, has been a major
influence on John's career, inspiring him to pursue a career in supply chain
management. Folu's exemplary leadership qualities have left a lasting
impression on John, to the extent that he would wake up on Monday mornings
looking forward to working with him. Additionally, at SFBU, Executive Vice
President Paul Choi's work ethic and drive have influenced John's approach to
his career.
John believes that success is "making the most of the moment and giving the
very best to everything you do. It's a journey, never a destination."
John's advice to current and prospective students is this:
#### _"There is more to SFBU than what you get in class and what you have been
asked to do by your professors, so take advantage of every opportunity SFBU
has to offer you!"_
Congratulations and best wishes, John, throughout your next journey and

### Your search yielded no results.
  * Search looks for exact, case-insensitive keywords; keywords shorter than a minimum length are ignored.
  * Use upper-case OR to get more results. Example: cat OR dog (content contains either "cat" or "dog").
  * You can use upper-case AND to require all words, but this is the same as the default behavior. Example: cat AND dog (same as cat dog, content must contain both "cat" and "dog").
  * Use quotes to search for a phrase. Example: "the cat eats mice".
  * You can precede keywords by - to exclude them; you must still have at least one "positive" keyword. Example: cat -dog (content must contain cat and cannot contain dog).

#  Student Health Insurance
All students must have health insurance while studying at SFBU, both when
enrolled in courses and during any breaks. SFBU offers a student health
insurance plan at reasonable rates. The cost of insurance appears on the
"Tuition and Fees" slide of the Registration Procedures document on [Schedule
of Class](/academics/class-schedule) page.
#### Health Insurance Coverage Period
Health insurance coverage is divided into three periods: Spring (January 1 -
April 30); Summer (May 1 -August 31); and Fall (September 1 - December 31). If
a student buys health insurance on or before the 30th day of the coverage
period, his or her coverage starts from the beginning of the period. If a
student buys health insurance after the 30th day of the coverage period, his
or her coverage starts on the date of purchase.
For example, students who buy health insurance on January 30 for the Spring
coverage period are covered for the entire Spring coverage period, so any
problems which started between January 1 and January 29 are covered. However,
students who buy health insurance on February 1 are covered only for the
period from February 1 through April 30.
#### Current SFBU Students
If you have other valid U.S. health insurance, and you do not want to purchase
health insurance through SFBU, your insurance plan documents must be uploaded
to your portal **before** you register for courses.
#### Incoming New Students
health insurance through SFBU, your insurance plan documents may be uploaded

### Understanding Institutional Research
Institutional research (IR) helps institutions like SFBU to make decisions
based on data. It involves identifying data, compiling it logically, and then
analyzing it for the benefit of all department decision-makers, including
those in admissions, academics, and marketing. The IR team works closely with
other departments to improve the institution's practices.
### Core Functions of the IR Department
The Institutional Research (IR) Department's mission is to provide data and
insight for the institution to assist the institution in achieving student
academic success. Data is disseminated to all departments as well as the Board
of Directors in order to drive informed decision-making.
In addition, the IR Department collects and reports data for its governing
bodies and accrediting agencies.
#### [Institutional Data](/academics/ir/graduation-rates)
San Francisco Bay University utilizes the student entering cohort to track
graduation rates. Graduation rates are based on the calendar year, and include
all students in the cohort excluding student deaths or students called to
active military service. Both the 100% on-time and 150% on-time completion is
reflected at the undergraduate and graduate levels. For the undergraduate
level, 100% on-time is equal to 4 years, and 150% on-time is equal to 6 years.
For the graduate level, 100% on-time is equal to 2 years, and 150% on-time is
equal to 3 years.

#  Silicon Valley's Top Companies Surround our Bay Area University
![Silicon Valley Tech
Companies](/sites/default/files/2022-04/SiliconValleyTechCompanies_lg.jpeg)
San Francisco Bay University's new campus sits amidst the apex of innovation.
Silicon Valley sets the tone for the rest of the globe in high technology and
design. We are proud to graduate students in computer science and engineering
that go on to build lucrative careers for themselves, either here in the
U.S.A. or in other countries. The fact is we are located in a pretty magical
location. What makes it so great?
According to the [Brookings
Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/research/tech-is-still-concentrating/),
while the tech sector is lifting the economy as a whole, most of those job
benefits are concentrated in just a few places, and one of those is here.
Their report notes that 90% of all innovation sector employment growth in the
past 15 years has taken place in Seattle, Boston, San Francisco, San Diego,
and San Jose, California. This should be a surprise to no one. That's why at
San Francisco Bay University, we pride ourselves on our location - as a high-
tech university in the San Francisco Bay Area - amidst some of the biggest
movers and shakers in the tech industry.
It is important to note that tech jobs are in high demand and represent the
strongest growing occupational cohort. According to the [U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-
technology/home.htm), employment in computer and information technology
occupations is expected to grow by 13% from 2020 to 2030. This represents a
faster growth rate than the average for all other occupations. The fact is
this: Jobs in the innovation sector are going to grow, year-after-year, for
the foreseeable future.
But why the high demand? Because jobs in cloud computing, big data collection
and storage, and information security seem to grow by the day. Technological
advancements evolve faster and faster, and as our world changes, the industry
needs professionals who understand advanced concepts and know how to operate
advanced machinery and technologies. Even ancillary industries, such as
computer systems design, management, and technical consulting services will
all see big-time growth in the coming decade.
## Why the Bay Area is a High-Tech Hub
There is no doubt about it. Silicon Valley has emerged as the destination of
choice for startups and established tech companies. Even international tech
companies have made big efforts to establish a foothold in the Bay Area. They
know that Bay Area colleges and universities - much like SFBU - graduate
students that are ready for future-proofed jobs. Being a university in Silicon
Valley, we understand this imperative quite well.
Silicon Valley, which is located in the southern region of the San Francisco
Bay Area of California, is widely known as a global center of technological
design and innovation. There is a reason why Silicon Valley is named after the
primary material in computer microprocessors. There is a wealth of technology,
software, hardware, and internet companies here, of all sizes.
Silicon Valley is also one of the wealthiest regions in the world and
certainly is one of the hottest real estate markets. In the end, much of the
success of Silicon Valley can be attributed to the social and cultural aspects
of the tech community that set up shop here.
But that's not all:
  * **Location-Specific Benefits:** Similar markets and industries tend to concentrate in particular areas. Dedicated marketplaces and malls exist for a reason. Competitors lining up close to each other does not happen by chance. Not only do people prefer a variety of choices, but it is easy to build infrastructure and similar businesses where others have already done so.
  * **Networking and Specialization:** Silicon Valley is consistently characterized by innovation, collaboration, and risk-taking. And since everyone is here, it is easy to connect with experienced and supportive mentors and other individuals in a particular industry or field of study. Finance companies go to Wall Street and tech companies go to Silicon Valley.
  * **Local Opportunities:** The timely availability of information and insights through a local network is vital for startups and established businesses alike. Here in Silicon Valley, the free flow of information provides itself as a one-stop-shop with seminars, product fairs, meetups, events, and workshops. This is where people rub elbows and learn the latest and greatest in technology and innovation.
With so many reasons to establish a tech presence in Silicon Valley, it's no
surprise that some of the top tech companies in the world are right here.

#  San Francisco Bay University Admissions and Program Information
![A group student are having
discussion](/sites/default/files/2022-04/ACloserLook_lg.jpeg)
We know that colleges and universities in the Bay Area are in hot demand.
Prospective students in the U.S. and all over the world hold the California
university system in high regard. People want to learn here.
So, what are the types of programs that might draw a student to SFBU? Read on
as we dive into the programs San Francisco Bay University offers.
## What Levels of University Programs are Offered at SFBU?
SFBU is proud to offer undergraduate and graduate degree programs. An
undergraduate degree is the first level of university studies you can apply
for straight from high school, or transfer into from a community college or
other undergraduate institution. An undergraduate program is what you complete
to earn your bachelor's degree. Graduate degrees represent both master's and
doctoral-level degrees. At San Francisco Bay University, you can earn a
master's degree by completing one of our graduate programs. SFBU programs have
a certain number of required courses you need to take - along with your
electives - to obtain your degree.
## What Business Undergraduate and Graduate Programs Does SFBU Offer?
San Francisco Bay University's School of Business and Information Technology
provides both bachelor's and master's degree programs. SFBU offers these
programs to help students develop career-focused business and technology
competencies. Students complete these programs empowered and insightful; ready
to enter the workplace as solution-oriented leaders and lifelong learners.
The School of Business and Information Technology is committed to providing
excellence in education. Our programs are designed to help students build a
portfolio of professional skills through continuously updated curricula,
modern facilities, and new technologies across all programs and courses. SFBU
students use technology to their advantage in the learning environment.
People here in the San Francisco Bay Area love new ideas. And they are not shy
about bringing them up in conversation. It isn't a matter of arrogance, but
more of confidence and inquisitiveness. The schools, businesses, and
governments of Northern California foster an environment of participation and
contribution. They live by the idea that you should bring something to teach
and be prepared to learn.
Prospective students have access to programs that include both a [Bachelor of
Science](https://sfbu.edu/academics/school-of-business/bsba) and [ Master of
Science](https://sfbu.edu/academics/school-of-business/mba) in Business
Administration. These programs are designed to help students grow and learn
where business, technology, science, and leadership intersect. Students are
exposed to tried-and-true management principles, best practices, data
management and analysis, and much more.
MBA students learn what it takes to be both an effective manager and leader in
the 21st century. From management to marketing, human resources, finance,
technology, and more - SFBU MBA students graduate fully prepared. Program
graduates are able to make efficient and effective decisions in today's
complex, fast-paced, and increasingly global society.
Students also have the option to fast-track their MBA - you can complete your
MBA in as little as one calendar year by taking 12 units/4 courses per
## What Engineering Undergraduate and Graduate Programs Does SFBU Offer?
The SFBU School of Engineering offers programs in both electrical engineering
and computer science. Both programs heavily rely on cutting-edge principles,
forward-thinking concepts, and hands-on learning.
At our School of Electrical Engineering, we bring the natural sciences,
engineering, and information technology together. We aim to provide our
students with a high-quality education in the field of electrical engineering,
while also encouraging their creativity, integrity, and research interest.
SFBU's School of Computer Science offers one of the most cutting-edge computer
science programs not just in California, but nationally. Graduates of our
computer science program can expect to make continuous contributions in
technological development and innovation in hardware, software, and networking
technology. Our computer science programs train the next generation of
innovators in computing technology.
Students enrolled in the [Bachelor of Science in Computer
Science](https://sfbu.edu/academics/school-of-engineering/bscs) program gain
the knowledge required to get sought-after high-technology jobs. And
graduating from a university in Silicon Valley certainly doesn't hurt. SFBU
computer science students graduate ready to master in-demand computing skills,
solve complex problems, and innovate in the technology sector.
From the everyday to the incredibly complex, students enrolled in our [ Master
of Science in Electrical Engineering](https://sfbu.edu/academics/school-of-
engineering/master-of-science-in-electrical-engineering) or [Computer
Science](https://sfbu.edu/academics/school-of-engineering/mscs) programs
become experts in subjects that influence the core of almost all technology.
Graduates will enter the workforce with advanced knowledge and hands-on
electronics engineering and computer science experience.
## How Should You Choose Your SFBU Program?
A [2019 study](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191014005009/en/New-
Survey-Student-Confusion-Selecting-Majors-Increases-Higher-Education-Cost-and-
Time-to-Earn-Degree) found that 51% of students were not confident in their
career path when they enrolled in college. Statistics like these don't make
choosing your university program any easier.
There is a reason why attending a college or university is such a high-
pressure decision. This is your career we're talking about. This is about the
rest of your life. It is no small matter and certainly requires a lot of
thought and consideration. What you major in; what program you study - these
decisions are not to be taken lightly.
That's why the first and best thing you can do is study your interests. Ask
yourself this simple question: "What interests me?" Because your interests are
one of the biggest factors when considering a university program. And studying
subjects that interest you makes university life a lot easier and more
enjoyable.
Location is another important consideration. Are you considering a university
program in Northern California? Certainly, this is an appealing environment,
and where you are shapes what interests you. Think about choosing a university
in a location with close proximity to companies where you might want to work
upon graduation. San Francisco Bay University's Silicon Valley location is
very advantageous to students looking to land a job with one of the nearby
tech companies.
It doesn't hurt to talk to friends, family, or even faculty. Don't hesitate to
[reach out with questions](https://sfbu.edu/contact-us) about your career and
SFBU program choices. We're here waiting to provide you with a first-class
education.
Do you have questions? Here at SFBU, we have answers. Feel free to [ contact
one of our counselors](https://sfbu.edu/student-life/counseling) or send us a

#  SFBU Student's Guide: How to Get Around the Bay Area
![City of San Francisco, cable car, Powell and
Market](/sites/default/files/2022-09/getting-around-the-Bay-Area-content.jpg)
If California is known for one thing, it is the big, sprawling cities that
anchor the northern and southern ends of the state. In Southern California,
Los Angeles and San Diego together form one, gigantic megalopolis. And yet,
Southern California is not well-known for its public transportation system.
We've all heard of New York's subway and Chicago's L-train, but have you heard
of the L.A. subway? The situation is a little different in Northern
California, where San Francisco's famous BART heavy-rail public transportation
system is quite well-known. Short for [Bay Area Rapid
Transit](https://www.bart.gov/), BART connects San Francisco colleges and
universities with downtown San Francisco, Chinatown, restaurants, the Golden
Gate Bridge, and so much more.
The fact is public transportation systems are part of the backbone of any
city. Public transportation provides people with a higher level of mobility,
especially in poor or underserved areas. In Fremont and Silicon Valley, not
only does public transportation open up routes to San Francisco colleges and
universities, no matter how near or far, but it provides access to employment,
community resources, healthcare, and recreational activities. Public
transportation benefits not only people who choose to ride it but those who
have no other choice. According to data from the Federal Highway
Administration, [over
90%](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/2002cpr/pdf/ch14.pdf) of public
assistance recipients do not own a car and instead rely on public
transportation to get around.
Comprehensive and widespread public transportation systems are critical for
the health of any city, but especially the big ones. Consider that slightly
more than 70% of all transit trips are made by passengers who use public
transportation five days or more per week. Pre-COVID, San Francisco public
transportation had swelled to its highest ridership in recorded history. The
BART system recorded, at its height, [426,758
riders](https://mtc.ca.gov/tools-resources/data-tools/monthly-transportation-
statistics) in September of 2019. Today, ridership is well below the peak but
is recovering. In January 2021, BART recorded 43,012 riders. This past January
2022, it nearly doubled to 83,790 riders. But is the BART the only way to get
around? Fortunately, whether you are going to or from San Francisco colleges
and universities or heading out to partake in a great [outdoor
activity](/blog/current/outdoor_activities), you've got options.
## A Comprehensive Guide to Getting To and From San Francisco Colleges and
Universities
Are you ready for a comprehensive San Francisco public transportation system
guide? We've got you covered. This primer will ensure you get where you need
to go without the excess stress. San Francisco's public transportation system
is managed by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). The
SFMTA governs everything from bicycle lanes to paratransit, parking, buses,
traffic, taxis, railways, ferries, and cable cars.
Public transportation in the Bay Area is quite extensive, which can also lead
to it being a bit confusing. It includes a rapid transit system, three
commuter rail lines, two light rail systems, two ferry systems, Amtrak inter-
city rail services, and four major overlapping bus agencies, in addition to
dozens of smaller ones.
San Francisco residents, current students, prospective students, and other
visitors to our great city have a wide variety of ticket options, transit
passes, and modes of transportation to choose from. Let's dive right in. These
are the four primary methods of public transportation in the metro area.
**1\. Cable Cars and Streetcars:** Did you know that the San Francisco cable
car system is the last manually operated cable car system in the world? The
cable car system in San Francisco is part of the intermodal transportation
network operated by the San Francisco Municipal Railway (SFMR). The SFMR
itself combines the Muni Metro modern light rail system with the E Market, F
Market, and wharves streetcar lines. The first cable car was put into
operation in 1873, which also makes San Francisco cable cars one of the oldest
cable car lines in the country. And while there were 23 cable car lines at its
height, today only three lines remain. What makes cable cars different from
other forms of public transportation in San Francisco is their user
demographic. Rather than commuters, most of the cable car ridership is
composed of tourists. Need routes or schedules? Here you go: [SFMTA Cable Cars
Information](https://www.sfmta.com/getting-around/muni/cable-cars).
**2\. Buses:** San Francisco is a fairly large city with hundreds of buses
circulating around its downtown area and beyond, which means a local bus can
take you just about anywhere. One of the best ways to get acclimated to the
San Francisco bus system is to grab a transport map. Bus stops also have maps
on large panels for easy reading. While bus operating times depend on the
line, most run between 5:00am and 1:00am. Frequencies also depend on line and
time, but one thing you can count on is that all lines that run through the
city center will go by every ten minutes or less. Bus fare is generally $2.00
for adults and $0.75 for children 5 to 17 and seniors over 65. For more
information on routes and schedules, go here: [San Francisco Muni Routes &
Stops](https://www.sfmta.com/getting-around/muni/routes-stops).
**3\. Trains:** While the San Francisco train system is comprehensive, it can
also be quite confusing. The SFMT train system includes BART, Caltrain, Golden
Gate Transit, VTA, AC Transit, SamTrans, and Amtrak Inter-City. These systems
make up light rail and commuter trains. The Caltrain itself is over 150 years
old and is one of the oldest methods of public transportation in San
Francisco. When combined with the bus system, city trains can get you just
about anywhere, whether you're going to one of San Francisco's colleges or
universities or otherwise. Since there are so many train options, we've found
a site that connects you to all of them here: [San Francisco
Trains](https://www.sanfranciscotrains.org/sf-rail-lines.html). Also, here is
the official list of [BART Schedules and
Maps](https://www.bart.gov/schedules). [The BART Trip
Planner](https://www.bart.gov/planner) also provides an interactive map that
students can use to plan their trips.
**4\. Ferries:** Being a coastal city, San Francisco also provides access to
ferries. While they run on limited schedules, ferries offer calm, quick,
traffic-free, and beautiful ways to get around the region. In fact, the San
Francisco ferry system is the oldest method of public transportation in the
city, with the first ferry being a sailboat ferry going into service in 1826.
Today, the San Francisco Bay Ferry and the Golden Gate Transit Ferry are the
two primary ferries in San Francisco. Here are your [San Francisco Bay Ferry
Schedules](https://sanfranciscobayferry.com/) and [Golden Gate Ferry
Schedules](https://www.goldengate.org/ferry/schedules-maps/).
## Public Transportation Options in Fremont, California
You need to know all the public transportation options in greater San
Francisco if you want to get around the region. But while SFBU is part of the
greater San Francisco colleges and universities area, it is still located
specifically in Fremont. So, what are the best tips and tricks for students
and otherwise who want to make their way around, in, out, and back to Fremont,
California?
1\. The most widely used and easily accessible station is the BART Fremont
Station. From the BART Fremont Station, students can either continue farther
out to Warm Springs, Milpitas, or Berryessa or head the other direction into
San Francisco proper or the airport.
2\. The AC Transit Fremont Station also provides transit options from Fremont
into town and back. For AC Transit Station bus schedules check out the [AC
Transit Trip Planner](https://www.actransit.org/).
3\. Finally, the [Altamont Commuter Express (ACE)](https://acerail.com/) runs
weekdays between Stockton and San Jose and serves ten stations, including
Lathrop/Manteca, Tracy, Vasco Road, Livermore, Pleasanton, Fremont, Great
America, and Santa Clara.
## Why Are Public Transportation Systems So Important?
Public transportation systems are a vital component of the healthy functioning
of cities large and small. Consider for a moment that in 2018 alone, over
[914,000 California
workers](https://www.livestories.com/statistics/california/transportation-
commute) commuted to and from work on a public transportation system. Without
an updated and viable public transportation system, local municipalities and
their economies would crumble. Even more, the environment would be far worse
off.
There is little doubt that the benefits of public transportation are amplified
when transit networks are planned, engineered, and implemented with
interconnectivity, rider experience, and efficiency in mind. Well-thought-out
public transportation systems have free amenities like public Wi-Fi, climate
control, and cell phone chargers. They may also provide access to food and
drink through on-site convenience stores or other retail outlets.
In the end, there is a reason why U.S. News & World Report ranked San
Francisco in a tie for first place with New York on their [_10 Best Cities for
Public Transportation_](https://www.usnews.com/news/cities/slideshows/10-best-
cities-for-transportation) list. With over 650,000 jobs accessible within a
30-minute ride, residents and SFBU students alike can probably get to work
faster on public transportation than sitting in traffic.
San Francisco also has a high commuter-to-rider ratio, with 36.5% of daily
commuters using public transit. And really, it should be no surprise
considering San Francisco has 26 transit routes within a half-mile of each
other. Whether you are an SFBU student making your way to and/or from one of
San Francisco's best university campuses or making your way around other
cities, [favorite beaches](/blog/alumni/sfbus-favorite-bay-area-beaches), or
suburbs in the area, you can rely on San Francisco's public transit system to
get you there!

#  The Best Way to Write Your Personal Statement When Applying for a
Scholarship
![A female student is writing her personal statement under the
sun](/sites/default/files/2022-08/Writing-Your-Personal-Statement-
content.jpeg)
Are you ready to begin your journey toward attending a university and
obtaining a degree that will change your life? The career of your dreams
awaits at the end of that journey. Your destination is right there on the
horizon. But are you concerned about how you will pay for your education? At
San Francisco Bay University, we take great pride in providing scholarships,
including housing scholarships, and tuition grants for students who seek to
study here. After all, some of [the best
companies](/blog/alumni/dominates_for_high-tech_Jobs) in the world call our
area home. Whether it be for an MBA or otherwise, we offer scholarships for
multiple disciplines. From BSCS to MSCS scholarships and more, it is important
to us that students obtain the help they need. But why is that?
Each year, more than [1.7
million](https://www.savingforcollege.com/article/college-scholarships-
statistics) private scholarships and fellowships are awarded. This may seem
like a big number, but also consider that approximately [19.4
million](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=372) students attended
U.S. colleges and universities per data reported in late 2020. That represents
only 8.76% of potentially eligible students who receive a scholarship to
attend the university of their choice. There is no doubt that more students,
both locally and globally, would benefit from obtaining a scholarship, whether
it be an MSCS scholarship or otherwise. And yet, obtaining a scholarship is
not as easy as simply asking for one. There are a series of steps you must
take to be on the receiving end of financial aid.
Colleges and universities generally look at a series of factors when
considering whom to award a scholarship, grant, or other forms of financial
aid. They include everything from previous academic performance (including
GPA) to volunteerism and a demonstrated aspiration or passion toward their
chosen field of study. One of the ways students show their aspiration or
passion is in their personal statement. The personal statement is used to
determine your level of interest and passion. It can be just as crucial to the
process as what your high school GPA was. That's why we wanted to dive a
little deeper into what makes a personal statement truly stand out. Let's use
an application for an MSCS scholarship as one example.
## Taking a Closer Look at an MSCS Scholarship Personal Statement
Let's take for example a student who has already received her or his BSCS
degree (Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science) degree. Now they want to
take their education and career opportunities to the next level. Yet, they may
have already put all their financial resources into getting their initial
degree. A scholarship might be just the answer to getting them across the
finish line towards receiving their MSCS (Master's of Science in Computer
Science) degree.
A critical part of scholarship applications is the personal statement.
Remember, you want to stand out from the crowd. Your personal statement should
represent your best characteristics and provide you with an opportunity to
stand out from the crowd. After all, you need to convince the committee
deciding who receives MSCS scholarships that you are worthy of the award. You
might have a truly remarkable curriculum vitae, but you are not the only
remarkable student applying for this scholarship. After all, in the United
States, there are roughly 65,000 CS graduates, which is less than [China and
Russia](https://thesassway.com/how-many-people-in-us-have-bachelors-in-
computer-science/), but the quality of education is higher in the U.S.,
according to international university rankings. This means competition for
scholarships in computer science and other disciplines is much tighter.
In many cases, it will be your personal statement that really sets you apart
from applicants who have equal if not better qualifications than you do.
Personal statements allow you to show your writing prowess and provide you
with an opportunity to tell your story in a compelling way. The veracity of
how you tell your story might be just what wins you that scholarship. Let's
take a closer look.
## How to Build a Beautiful and Compelling Personal Statement
Your personal statement is an important part of an MSCS scholarship
application. It's about more than your birth name and identification number. A
personal statement represents the ability to show how unique you are. Your
personal statement needs to be good. _Really_ good.
First, consider eliminating your character counter. Just let the thoughts flow
and tell your story. The last thing you want is for your word count to hit the
ceiling just as you are halfway through telling your story. Don't panic, just
keep writing. You can edit it later. In the end, you'll find it's easier to
compress and remove superfluous things than to limit yourself.
Second, do not place an arbitrary time limit on preparing your statement.
There is no need to rush. Reflect on your accomplishments and take a couple of
hours to really dig into who you are and why you would be an excellent fit for
a scholarship award. Find the perfect words and expressions that demonstrate
your qualities and what makes you special. A good writer's technique is to
write a composition, take a break for a day or two, then come back and read
it. Revelations may come to you after you've had a night to sleep on it.
Lastly, consider your language. To 'accomplish' something sounds so much
better than to 'do' it. For international students who do not speak English as
their first language, there are some good translation and synonym programs and
search functionalities on the internet or in a physical thesaurus or
dictionary. Whatever you use, there are many great resources to help you find
better words to complete a thought in a more elegant or effective way. But do
not be overly flowery in your verbiage. The true master shows skill while
practicing restraint.
## Above All, It's About your Strengths
In the limited number of words that you have, it is important for you to sell
yourself to the university. When a product is being offered to someone, the
proponent of the product generally talks about how great that thing is. You
are not a product, but there should be no problem talking about how great you
are. Write about your experiences, your skills, your knowledge, and your
future plans and desires. Why dwell on where you've gone wrong? No, you want
to focus on where you've gone right. But it also might not hurt to show a bit
of humility and articulate an experience in which you learned from a mistake.
As you focus on what you do best, make sure you include it somehow in your
opening and closing statements. How you introduce yourself and what you
conclude on will make all the difference in how the university administrator
remembers your story. Starting with something funny, interesting,
inspirational, or surprising will often provide a good first impression.
Making someone smile is a great way to be introduced. But don't dwell too long
on your opening and closing statements. As you write out your personal
statement, the proper opening and closing statements may just come to you out
of nowhere.
Finally, _do it yourself_. Don't pay someone to write it for you. It must be
written in your own voice and be constructed of your own work and ideas.
Here's a pro tip: don't read any other personal statements before reading
yours. You are unique, and it will do you little good to follow someone else's
rules or patterns as to what you should do and how you should write it.
Now, how do you feel? Are you ready to sit down and write the best personal
statement of your life? If you aren't quite there yet but would like [more

#  What Makes California Universities and Colleges So Special?
![California
Map](https://www.sfbu.edu/sites/default/files/2022-04/CaliforniaUniversities_lg.jpeg)
California has long been a place where individuals come to attain a first-
class higher education. While much of the history of the United States is
interwoven into the fabric of East Coast Ivy League universities, the spirit
of the wild west endures in California universities and colleges. San
Francisco Bay University is proud to uphold this tradition.
California is a popular destination for high school students from Asian
countries especially. It's just a quick hop across the Pacific Ocean and
before you know it you find yourself studying at a high-caliber institution.
Still, California did not just become a hot spot of academic excellence
overnight. It took hundreds of years of development, from the good old days to
modern times, for cities in California to become hotbeds of innovation and
culture. California is a melting pot, and as such, the diverse array of
individuals, companies, and organizations make this a fantastic place to
learn.
With a GDP of [ $2.8 trillion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/187834/gdp-
of-the-us-federal-state-of-california-since-1997/), California would slot
between Germany and the United Kingdom in the world's top economies, and by
itself makes up for 14% of the US economy. It is, without a doubt, a major
economic growth engine of the United States. Obviously, Germany and the U.K.
are both very desirable places for students looking to get a degree, and here
is California, right there among them. It is this level of excellence and
sheer grandiosity of California that seeps into the colleges and universities
that dot the state.
## Northern California From Then to Now
One of the key reasons why Northern California is such a powerhouse of
innovation and investment is that there is a culture of collaboration, even
between groups that could be seen as competitors. If you live in Northern
California or San Francisco, you understand why our culture fosters
innovation.
We don't like to do something the "traditional" way. We pride ourselves on
being forward thinkers and innovators. In the area around Silicon Valley,
Berkeley, and the San Francisco Bay, there is an eagerness to be first,
whether it be the first to try a new experience, the first to buy from a new
company or to test a new piece of technology.
Yet, this wasn't always the case. The history of innovation in the Bay Area
took a long time to write and went through a series of convulsions. The Bay
Area's progressive spirit was a shock to many in the 80s. And throughout the
decades, it has been this progressive spirit that has defined the culture of
Northern California.
## The Evolution of Northern California as a Culture and Technological
Powerhouse
The 80s in California was a time for makers. Whether it be unique clothes,
posters, or furniture, it was in San Francisco where the West Coast punk scene
thrived. Then, by the mid-90s, the worlds of technology and design began to
collide. Computers were still novel items, certainly not in every home, and we
were transitioning from the pager to the cell phone, now smartphone. It was a
technology company right here in neighboring Cupertino that led the charge in
combining the best of cutting-edge technology and spectacular, eye-catching
design. And it is to this day that Apple, Inc. serves as a top destination for
computer science majors, computer engineers, MBA students, and more.
Forward-thinking companies in Silicon Valley spent the 90s and early-2000s
immersed in technology, software, mass-manufacturing and user-experience.
Whether it be in hardware or software, the behemoths of the tech world
integrated the best principles of design and technology. And they did so with
the help of students who graduated from Northern California universities and
colleges.
Now, here we are in 2022 and the world has changed. We work in a highly
technological society. As such, students who want good paying jobs that will
last should study disciplines that will prepare them for a cutting-edge
future.
Today, students who graduate with a Masters in Computer Science from SFBU can
not only gain a glimpse into, but directly affect, how design and technology
shape our world today. The multicultural and multidisciplinary approach to
creating change is everywhere, both at SFBU and other colleges and
universities in the California system.
Here at SFBU, we are proud to be one of many California colleges and
universities offering a first class education. Yet, we stand apart. We focus
on providing an education on par with the best universities and colleges in
the United States, but we offer it at affordable prices.
## California Universities and Colleges Share Top Rankings
All you have to do is have a look at any one of [ Money's Best Colleges and
Universities ](https://money.com/best-colleges/rankings/) rankings to see that

#  The Student's Guide: 5 Things to Consider When Choosing a Northern
California University
![A happy female student is sitting on the
grass](/sites/default/files/2022-08/choosing-a-northern-california-university-
Did you know that there are 90 universities in Northern California? And
there's a good reason for it. California's [$2.6 trillion
economy](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/04/17/how-gdp-of-us-states-
compares-to-countries-around-the-world/39295197/) is larger than all but half
a dozen countries worldwide. This is the home of some of the largest tech
companies in the world. The people in California are known for being warm and
welcoming. We stand open to the world. California is also famous for its warm
weather, stunning coastal beaches, and hoppin' cities. From Hollywood to
Silicon Valley, California has it all. But why do so many non-California
residents choose a university in Northern California?
Nationally, Northern California is a significant contributor to the
agricultural, aerospace, and manufacturing sectors, which is why many
universities have created high-quality and affordable programs that focus on
engineering and technology, among other fields. Because of its size, Northern
California is a large area, which allows students to choose just about any
field of study. And some of the nation's top universities are right here in
Northern California. This area is known for the high quality of its academic
institutions. And with some of the biggest and most influential companies here
in Northern California, our universities provide highly-educated and success-
driven graduates for their recruiting programs. Here at SFBU, we are proud to
sit right smack in the midst of some of the [top technology
companies](/blog/alumni/dominates_for_high-tech_Jobs) in the world. And we are
also proud to have had some of our students move on to jobs at these very
companies.
Are you a prospective student considering California as a destination for
higher education? Certainly, there are some considerations. Universities in
Northern California and around the San Francisco area have a lot to offer, but
Northern California is not for everyone. Let's take a look at the top 5 things
you should consider when choosing a Northern California University.
## 1\. Location, Location, Location
It isn't just about where you buy a house or start a business. Universities in
Northern California are spread across a wide geographic area. If you are a
local student, you may live at home or with relatives. However, international
students who travel here to study may need to consider distance and public
transportation. Not everyone will have a car. Fortunately, San Francisco has
been ranked as the [second best city for public
transportation](https://www.sfmta.com/blog/san-francisco-ranked-2-best-cities-
public-transit).
Expenses must also be considered. Certainly, leaving home and striking out on
your own is exciting. No longer living under your parents roof and socializing
with other students is going to be fun, but you must also be self-reliant.
There are a lot of activities that students attending a university in Northern
California can choose from when it comes to things to do. Not everything is
free. But fortunately, our geographic location offers tons of opportunities
for [great outdoor fun](/blog/current/outdoor_activities) which is generally
free or inexpensive.
The good news is that one of SFBU's scholarship programs provides housing
assistance. And, our [housing options](/student-life/housing) allow for ease
of access to local restaurants and activities. As with your normal
application, we recommend completing your housing request as soon as possible
as housing assistance is provided on a first come first served basis. Getting
your paperwork in early is important no matter what university you apply to.
## 2\. University Type, Size, Quality, and Reputation
Every university in Northern California offers a different student experience.
The type of experience prospective students receive is entirely up to them.
Older universities are generally more research-oriented and offer more
traditional courses. You will also find a large cohort of newly graduated high
school students at older, more traditional universities. On the other side of
the coin, smaller, newer universities are more vocationally oriented, so you
will find an older cohort and more part-time students.
Universities also vary in size. One of our neighboring universities, the
University of California, Berkeley, has over 42,000 students. That's a huge
number where lectures are given to hundreds of students at a time. Here at San
Francisco Bay University, we focus on a smaller cohort of students so that our
professors can pay close attention to individual student successes.
Also, consider the quality and reputation of the institution you plan to join.
Every university has its own reputation and quality varies from one to
another. We are proud to maintain a solid [5-Star rating on
Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=san+francisco+bay+university+fremont&sxsrf=ALiCzsZHrZe5dv4k5E3ZrXfhAPLCpep4Xw%3A1652377088855&source=hp&ei=AEZ9YoXLMvTVkPIP_t6MWA&iflsig=AJiK0e8AAAAAYn1UEBQozH2rRwSw81wfQ7QkdbrC2PMW&oq=san+f&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAEYADIECCMQJzIECCMQJzIECCMQJzIFCC4QgAQyBQguEIAEMgUILhCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQguEIAEMgUILhCABDIFCC4QgAQ6DgguEIAEEMcBENEDENQCOgsILhCABBDHARDRAzoLCC4QgAQQxwEQowI6CAguEIAEENQCUABY7AZgzRJoAHAAeACAAbYEiAGCCZIBCTAuMy4xLjUtMZgBAKABAQ&sclient=gws-
wiz#lrd=0x808fc7a85b65e063:0x49e86fc067913e6f,1,,,) and several other online
listings and [review sites](https://birdeye.com/san-francisco-bay-
university-164616855878115).
## 3\. Area of Study
The program you choose will play an important role in the university you
choose. At San Francisco Bay University, we offer programs in the following
disciplines:
  * [School of Engineering](/academics/school-of-engineering) (Computer Science and Electrical)
  * [School of Business](/academics/school-of-business) (BSBA and MBA)
  * [Intensive English Program ](/iep)
There is a method behind the disciplines our students have to choose from.
Being a Silicon Valley-based university, we feel some of the best job
opportunities available to our graduating cohort are right here in our area.
And the degrees they can choose from fit right in with what the companies
around us require. We also offer an Intensive English Program because we offer
[generous scholarships and tuition grants](/admissions/scholarships) and we
get a lot of interest from international students whose first language might
not be English.
Obviously, there are programs and disciplines that are not present. We don't
have drama or liberal arts programs. Certainly, these are important areas of
study, but they may be better suited for other locations and academic
institutions. Here at SFBU, we looked closely at students evaluating what a
Northern California university might need, and we chose our courses
accordingly.
## 4\. University Facilities
Facilities differ by university because they depend on the building and the
university utilities. Some universities have huge, old libraries. Others have
massive research facilities. Still, you don't have to impress with advanced
facilities. Sometimes an open, clean campus with spacious classrooms,
recreation areas, outdoor spaces, and big communal areas is all a student
needs. We've put together a great [virtual tour of our
campus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdUPsf4Rxo&t=1s), which is big,
beautiful, and brand-new.
This is not just an important consideration for what facilities the university
has. What facilities they _don't_ have is also important. Sports might be
important to you. If the university you choose does not offer sports
facilities or have a sports program, and this is something you want, then a
Northern California university just might not be for you!
Also, consider lingering COVID restrictions and impacts on university
facilities. For example, here at San Francisco Bay University, we are still
unable to offer food services in our diner due to COVID restrictions. Other
institutions may be facing the same problem. Fortunately, we have a ton of
great dining options within walking distance of our campus.
## 5\. Resources and Support Systems
As a new student, you're going to have a lot of questions. Look for a
university that has your long-term success in mind. You may have housing
questions when you arrive, but you may need career advice before you graduate.
The university you choose should be able to provide these services to you.
Make sure the counselors you work with view and help you as a whole person and
not just a student.
Before choosing a university or college in California, make sure the school
can accommodate any medical or special learning requirements you may have.
When dealing with the homesickness and pressure that comes from attending a
university, make sure your university has adequate counseling and health and
wellness services.
Writing and tutoring services are generally ubiquitous among institutes of
higher education, but you still want to check the quality and availability of
those resources. Are they conveniently accessible should you need them?
Finally, do they offer comprehensive access to [alumni
services](https://alumni.sfbu.edu/)? You will always be a part of the
institution you graduate from. How accessible they remain after graduation
matters.
Certainly, there are more considerations. Embarking on a journey of higher
education is no small matter. Wherever you choose to get your next degree,
keep these tips in mind and you'll be sure to make the right decision. Think
you may want to choose San Francisco Bay University? Call us at 510-803-SFBU.
#  The Student's Guide: Opportunities After Graduating from San Francisco Bay
University
![Two females are talking each other with a big smile in a conference
room](/sites/default/files/2022-08/Opportunities-After-Graduation-
We would like to think San Francisco Bay University graduates have a ton of
opportunities available to them upon graduation. Not only are we in a prime
location, surrounded by tech companies of all varieties, but we have the
resources, services, and networking opportunities only a place like a
university in the San Francisco Bay Area can deliver. Even more, we put a
laserlike focus on programs that we think will provide SFBU graduates the
chance to land the job of their dreams. Computer science is an example.
According to government statistics, the employment of computer and information
research scientists is expected to [grow by
22%](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-and-
information-research-scientists.htm) from 2020 to 2030. And that's why we
offer a top-notch Bay Area computer science program.
But it does not stop there. We also offer a degree program with a focus on
electrical engineering. While the job outlook for electrical engineers is not
as explosive as it is for computer science majors, the demand for electrical
engineers is not projected to drop anytime soon. From 2020 to 2030, the
overall employment outlook for electronics engineers is projected to [grow by
7%](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-and-
information-research-scientists.htm). And with the number of engineering
graduates growing at [a rate of 1.44%](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-
information-technology/computer-and-information-research-scientists.htm)
between 2018 and 2019, there simply will not be enough graduates to fill the
need. Jobs will be plentiful and SFBU electrical engineering graduates will
benefit.
Prospective SFBU students can also study business administration and go for
their MBA. While some have said the market for MBA graduates is saturated,
consider that the percentage of companies hiring MBAs has not dropped. In
fact, it has stayed relatively steady since 2017. Let's look at [the
data](https://www.statista.com/statistics/233189/hiring-rate-of-mba-
graduates/):
  * 2017: 70%
  * 2018: 67%
  * 2019: 76%
  * 2020: 80%
As you can see, the market for MBA graduates has remained relatively steady
over the last half-decade. The need for well-rounded graduates in the national
and international business world has not dropped. We're proud to know the
future is bright not just for Bay Area computer science program graduates, but
for MBA graduates as well. Now, let's look at each category.
## Bay Area Computer Science Programs Are in Hot Demand
There is a reason why Bay Area computer science programs are in such high
demand. Just consider for a moment that California's tech industry employed
more than one million professionals in 2021. That [represents
10%](https://www.cyberstates.org/#interactiveMap?geoid=6__california) of
California's entire workforce. Not only that, but California consistently
offers some of the highest wages and benefits for tech positions out of any
state, according to [U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes150000.htm) data.
Computer science graduates also have a wealth of career opportunities to
choose from, including, but not limited to:
  * Software Developers
  * Software Engineers
  * Computer Systems Analysts
  * Information Systems Managers
  * Cybersecurity Analysts
  * Game Designers
  * UX Designers
  * Web Designers
  * Web Developers
  * Machine Learning Engineers
  * Forensic Computer Analysts
  * ... and many more!
Quite frankly, the list goes on. As the future becomes more technologically
advanced, fields like nanotechnology, quantum computing, and engineering will
become even more important. As 5G cellular technology matures and evolves into
whatever comes next, network engineers and telecommunications researchers will
be in higher demand.
And don't worry about graduating without work experience. There are
opportunities for Bay Area computer science program graduates. Whether it be
in the form of IT-related work placements, internships, or shadowing
opportunities, typically once you show your mettle, the company you're working
with will bring you on full-time.
It may also be useful to develop a personal portfolio of computer science-
related projects, whether they involve programming, website development, or
even online moderation. If you can show initiative by fixing bugs, improving
functionality, or even building a useful application, companies will find you
highly desirable.
## How to Make a Degree in Electrical Engineering Work for You
As we mentioned before, the need for electrical engineers in the workplace is
not diminishing. Obtaining a degree in electrical engineering is not a bad
idea for those interested. Consider that according to the latest LinkedIn
recruiting data, there are over 71,000 graduate electrical engineering jobs
currently open in the United States. Companies simply cannot fill these
positions fast enough. Graduates with electrical engineering degrees can
choose from careers in a wide range of engineering industries. And that's the
beauty of obtaining an electrical engineering degree from SFBU. You could use
it for just about any discipline. Here are some examples of jobs you could
potentially go for with a degree in electrical engineering:
  * Aerospace Engineers
  * CAD Technicians
  * Broadcast Engineers
  * Nuclear Engineers
  * Special Effects Technicians
  * Technical Sales Engineers
  * Land-Based Engineers
The beauty of engineering degrees is that you typically can gain hands-on
experience and practical understanding of specialized industries with an
electrical engineering degree alone. Companies will generally hire you knowing
you have the skillset on a broader level, then train you to be a specialist
wherever they need you.
When you join companies in this fashion, you will generally work alongside
other engineers from other disciplines, but your role will be to provide
electrical engineering expertise. However, depending on your skill level and
the company you sign on with, you may develop into a more "generalist"
engineer. You may wind up picking up knowledge from other areas and studying
multiple disciplines, which only increases your value to the company.
## Opportunities That Lie in Obtaining your MBA
Economic changes have led to an increase in the quality and quantity of job
opportunities for MBA graduates. Because of historically low unemployment
rates, MBA graduates have a high level of negotiation power when looking for
the perfect job. The fact is everyone today is more valuable than they were
even a few years ago. Companies are paying higher salaries and looking for
more graduates. The median starting salary for MBA hires is around $115,000
per year, which certainly is nothing to shake a stick at.
Like Bay Area computer science programs and electrical engineering graduates,
MBA graduates have a wide array of jobs to choose from upon graduation. Some
examples include:
  * Business Consultants
  * Accounting Consultants
  * Investment Bankers
  * Logistics Managers
  * Healthcare Managers
  * Marketing Managers
  * Business Operation Specialists
  * Sales Managers
  * Financial Managers
What is great about an MBA is that you can replace the word "manager" in the
aforementioned examples with the word "director" or even "vice president"
depending on your experience and skill level. The number of employment
opportunities for MBA graduates and the need for managers and directors only
increases by the year.
MBA professors here at SFBU urge our business school graduates to use their
marketable skills to look for job opportunities in the area of business
analytics, change management, supply chain management (in hot demand during
today's supply chain crisis), and project management. These are the types of
MBA-related positions in high demand in our local area.
Graduates should consider what their initial dream job would be and then adapt
their job search to fit their desires. An MBA is such a versatile degree that
graduates really have more choice than graduates from just about any other
discipline. And it is also a reason why so many prospective students choose to
obtain an MBA over other degree options.
At SFBU, we proudly offer [scholarships, grants, and tuition
assistance](/admissions/scholarships) for students from the United States and
abroad in whatever area of study they are interested in. We have chosen these
fields of study because of our specialized location and the unique need for
graduates in these disciplines. Want to learn more about the potential
opportunities available to you as a student at San Francisco Bay University?
Simply get in touch with our [admissions office](/admissions) and we'll be
happy to answer all your questions.
#  5 Best Day Trips in the Bay Area
![A grape vineyard in California under the
sunset](/sites/default/files/2022-08/Day-Trips-in-the-Bay-Area-content.jpeg)
The San Francisco Bay Area has so much to offer that people could spend a week
here and still find new things to explore and do. Yet, there are also
fantastic day trip options within spitting distance of San Francisco and the
universities in Fremont, California. We've covered a lot of ground when it
comes to Bay Area activities. Everything from our favorite [outdoor
activities](/blog/current/outdoor_activities) to our recommended options for
students [taking their parents out](/blog/current/parents_visiting) on the
town - we've introduced you to lots of options. Now we want to spread our
wings a little and take you outside the Bay Area to surrounding cities and
towns because some of Northern California's best offerings don't necessarily
lie within city limits. The question is: where to?
Sure, everyone knows about Sausalito day trips, but what else is out there?
Fortunately, a lot. So much that we even discovered new things as we
researched this article. That's why it was so difficult to choose only five.
So, how did we do it? Well, we took into consideration everything from the
sights to sounds, culture, adventure, traveler sentiment, variety, and local
insight. It wasn't an easy list to put together, but we think we've managed
it. Are you ready to venture out of Fremont and see what the wider area around
the San Francisco Bay Area has to offer? Let's dive right in!
## 1\. [California's Great America](https://www.cagreatamerica.com/)
While Southern California likes to lay claim to the title of "Theme Park
Capital of California," Northern California is no slouch. Enter California's
Great America, a theme park in Santa Clara. It's about a 1 hour and 45-minute
drive from Fremont but head out early so you have time to navigate the lines.
California's Great America has some awesome rides like the Gold Striker, a
giant wooden roller coaster. It's also got a whitewater rafting ride and a
single-rail steel roller coaster. There's a food court, souvenirs, and
merchandise for those who are visiting from outside California.
Attached to California's Great America is the Boomerang Bay Water Park, which
is open during the summer season and is a great place for students or visiting
families to splash around during the hot summer months. The maze of slides and
tubes will leave you cooled off and smiling in delight, no matter your age
bracket. Finally, there's Planet Snoopy and Kidzville, which is another
separate amusement area for young kids. Live stage productions are held all
day long. From September through October, Great America holds its Halloween
Haunt, which has haunted houses, costumed actors, and scares of all shapes and
sizes. Are you ready to leave the confines of the universities in Fremont and
embrace your inner child? If so, head on over to California's Great America
for the day!
## 2\. [Napa Valley](https://www.napavalley.com/explore/)
We're taking you to the exact opposite side of the equation now. If spending
your day at an adventure theme park isn't something that excites you, consider
something much more adult. Enter Napa Valley. It doesn't get much more adult
than one of the premier wine destinations not just in California, but the
world. SFBU students and visitors should consider themselves lucky to have
access to such a high-demand destination.
For day trippers, the best way to get a full feel of Napa Valley will be on
the Napa Valley Wine Train, which travels to nearby St. Helena and back,
snaking through scenic hills and vineyards along the way. It's a gorgeous and
quick way to get a feel for Napa Valley without the need to stay overnight. In
the end, one should raise their expectations. Napa Valley grants travelers
access to 400-plus wineries, the Calistoga hot springs and mineral pools, and
a handful of Michelin-starred establishments. Whether you are into wine, food,
or scenic views, Napa Valley is a true treat for anyone who wants to day trip
out from SFBU or another university in Fremont and explore some of the best
Northern California has to offer.
**BONUS TIP** : While this category is meant to highlight Napa Valley, we want
to provide a more inexpensive and family-friendly option:
[Sonoma](https://www.sonoma.com/)! About 45 miles north of San Francisco,
Sonoma also boasts dozens of wineries and exclusive eateries but also offers
Safari Park West and the nearby Sonoma Coast State Park.
## 3\. [Filoli Estate & Gardens](https://filoli.org/)
Just 25 miles south of San Francisco, the Filoli Estate & Gardens encompasses
nearly 700 acres of wild parkland, 16 immaculately landscaped gardens, and a
historical mansion with several rooms open to the public. Filoli was built 10
years after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and was seen at the time of its
building as a symbol of hope amid the ruin. Its stunningly beautiful English
Renaissance gardens are considered by many to be among some of the best
English garden replicas in the United States.
And it's these gardens that hold the charm the Estate is known for. Beautiful
flowers, gigantic trees, and perfectly manicured gardens lie behind huge
shrubbery stands. Even better, the gardens constantly change based on the
season, so true anthophiles will find reasons to visit multiple times
throughout the year. If the size of the grounds and mansion seems imposing,
consider a 1-hour guided tour. The estate often hosts special events as well,
so be sure to visit their website for more information.
While the gardens and grounds steal the show, the mansion itself is quite
special. From the flower-covered portico to a grand marble foyer and huge
ballroom, it's a building that will take you back in time. Make note of the
massive vaulted ceilings that run the length of one of the house's wings and
are 174 feet long. There's also a reception room and a formal dining room that
has 20 seats and two marble fireplaces. So, for a relaxing day trip that will
transport you from the urban Fremont center to the 19th Century, head to
Filoli Estate & Gardens!
## 4\. [Armstrong Redwoods State Natural
Reserve](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=450)
Even though we are a university in Fremont, California, surrounded by dense
urban jungle and [Silicon Valley
heavyweights](/blog/alumni/dominates_for_high-tech_Jobs), there is a different
kind of jungle - forest, if you will - that we want to take you to. If you
haven't noticed by now, as an avid follower of the SFBU Blog, we love the
great outdoors. We love nature and activities that get you out and into the
wild, whether that be in the woods, up in the mountains, or lounging on the
beach. And what better way to have a uniquely Northern California day-trip
than by visiting the redwoods!
Naturally, most people are familiar with Redwoods National Park, but we wanted
to take you somewhere different to give you a two-for-one. Just under two
hours from Fremont, Armstrong Redwoods State Natural Reserve is an ancient
Redwood grove that feels as wild as it does timeless. Well-manicured trails
snake through over 800 acres of coastal redwood lands. And these redwoods,
quite literally, stand out. Some are more than 350 feet tall and over 2,000
years old. The Parson Jones tree is the largest tree in the grove and is
taller than the length of a football field. It's huge! And no matter what you
have in mind for your day trip, a nice picnic, a calm hike, or something more
strenuous, Armstrong State Natural Reserve has it all. Now, what's the two-
for-one we mentioned?
BONUS TIP: Located in Central Sonoma County, the town of Guerneville lies just
a stone's throw from the Armstrong Redwoods State Natural Reserve. It has long
been a weekend getaway and summer vacation spot for San Franciscans. But if
you get out early enough, you can make a full day-trip out of visiting the
town and the park. The town has tons of charm and its riverside location adds
an extra touch of beauty and serenity. If you're going to visit the redwoods
at Armstrong State Natural Reserve, well, you may as well add Guerneville into
the mix for a full day of natural and man-made merriment.
## 5\. [USS Hornet Museum](https://uss-hornet.org/)
As we made our way through various outdoor options, charming little towns, and
amusement parks, we came across a day-trip activity that stood out for its
uniqueness. A tour of the USS Hornet aircraft carrier! It's highly unlikely
that - unless you've served in the U.S. Navy - you have ever been on or seen
the inside of an aircraft carrier. These things are basically floating cities
and a tour of the USS Hornet is probably as close as you'll ever get to wander
around one.
Approximately one hour away from universities in Fremont, the USS Hornet is
parked at the pier in Alameda, California. Despite its sleek and high-tech
look, it was built in 1942 and played a significant role in World War II, the
Korean War, and the Vietnam War. Perhaps most interestingly, it was also used
to pick up and transport the Apollo astronauts as they returned home from the
moon. After a short 10-minute history and safety video, visitors are free to
roam about the vessel, with volunteers stationed throughout in case you have
any questions or get lost. With tons (and we mean that literally) of
passageways, compartments, and desks to explore, there's no doubt you'll
easily spend your full day enjoying this unique experience.
Well, there you have it! It wasn't easy for us to choose these five day trips
out of the many options we have. But we hope that SFBU students or anyone else
stumbling upon these options find them fun and enjoyable. Whether you are day-
tripping out from SFBU, a premier university in Fremont, California, or
somewhere else in the Bay Area - safe travels!
#  Why an MSCS Computer Science Degree is Right for You
![Smiling student working on computer](/sites/default/files/2022-11/MSCS-
computer-science-degree-content.jpeg)
Let's face it, the ROI you get from obtaining an MSCS computer science degree
is undeniable. MSCS graduates are instantly qualified to step into high-
paying, high-demand computer science careers. Graduates can then move on to
specialty areas of the field such as artificial intelligence, biomechanics,
robotics, cybersecurity, and coding.
Computer science graduates also have high earning potential upon graduation.
With a base salary of [$89,000 per
year](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Degree=Bachelor_of_Science_\(BS_%2F_BSc\)%2C_Computer_Science_\(CS\)/Salary),
it isn't long before computer science graduates are making six figures. And
when Forbes ranked graduate degrees by a salary increase, the M.S. in Computer
Science [came in
second](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2017/09/07/the-best-and-
worst-masters-degrees-for-jobs-in-2017/?sh=7008bc784cc3). Still, is this the
career for you?
Computer science graduates understand that this is a discipline that is best
learned by doing. Students must get down into the coding trenches and learn
the ins and outs of today's most advanced technology. It may seem difficult.
And because of this, some professionals with a bachelor's question whether a
master's in computer science is worth it. Are you asking yourself, "Should I
get an MSCS computer science degree?" Let's look at the pros and cons.
## Benefits of an MSCS Computer Science Degree
While a bachelor's in computer science will serve you well, you need more than
basic knowledge about computers and their applications. You still need a lot
of advanced and practical knowledge. A Master's degree represents a good way
to gain expert knowledge. An MSCS will also open up a lot of job
opportunities. You can secure your financial future by working for
[companies](/blog/alumni/dominates_for_high-tech_Jobs) that are in the Fremont
area.
Advanced computer knowledge is required for a significant number of in-demand
jobs. From scientists to technical experts, IT workers, data analysts, machine
learning specialists, cybersecurity experts, and more. These industries and
disciplines rely on advanced computer knowledge. And companies that operate
within these industries are willing to pay well and offer handsome benefits to
computer science graduates.
In addition to great pay, companies looking for computer science graduates
offer long-term job security, and continuous uptraining. And opportunities are
only growing. The job outlook for computer science graduates from 2021-2031,
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is 21%, or [much faster than
average](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-
and-information-research-scientists.htm). According to current data, this rate
is faster than the average of many other occupations.
## Technology is Always Changing
Technological advancements require quite a bit of lead time and research.
Computer technology is constantly growing, changing, evolving, and expanding
into society. Take data collection as just one example. The increasing need
for data collection requires the hiring of more data scientists. Just consider
that the world now generates an estimated [2.5 quintillion
bytes](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/feature/Big-data-
collection-processes-challenges-and-best-practices) of data every day. Where
does the data go? How do you collate and mine it? These are questions data
scientists ponder every day. It's exciting stuff!
Computer and research scientists are highly sought today because of the
interdependency on technological advancements and inventions. Interoperability
between systems has become a hot topic as disparate systems join each other in
the cloud. And as they join each other in the cloud, cybersecurity is more
important than ever.
Many MSCS computer science graduates will go on to work in network and cloud
security. Cyberattacks have become quite common and software engineers and
analysts are required to devise ways to minimize and mitigate the damage from
these threats. In fact, many computer scientists are involved in creating
entirely new programming languages for this purpose.
## Should You Apply for a Master's in Computer Science Program?
This is an appropriate question no matter what you study. "Should I study
[insert discipline here]" is a question asked by just about every student.
There are certainly arguments to be made on either side of an MSCS degree.
Certainly, you have already done the work on a bachelor's degree. But what it
really comes down to, as with almost everything else, is you. Here are some
questions to consider:
  * What are your goals?
  * Where do you see yourself in the next five to ten years?
  * Do you have the time (and money) to devote to school?
  * Does your employer expect you to get an advanced degree?
You, and only you, can determine if a computer science master's degree is
worth it.
As you finalize your decision, take some time to learn more about what an MSCS
computer science degree will do for you. Here are some questions to consider
as you make this evaluation:
  * Where can you take classes?
  * Are you a good candidate to pursue a master's in computer science?
  * How do you want to use the degree?
  * What is the cost of the degree?
  * What are your future salary expectations?
Considering these factors will put you on the right path to the right
decision.
## What Can You Expect from a Master's in Computer Science Degree Program in
the US?
Before you can decide to do a thing, you must know about it. Obviously, if
you've already studied for your bachelor's, then you have a pretty good idea
of what to expect. In short, a master's in computer science, or MSCS degree,
is a graduate degree that provides current computer scientists and engineers
with the opportunity to expand their knowledge base and gain a more
sophisticated understanding of development, troubleshooting, and advanced
principles. MSCS in computer science programs cover topics like computer
language theory, advanced software development, advanced algorithms, quantum
computing, machine learning, and more.
Ultimately, what you study will depend on your previous education and career
focus up to this point. Some CS master's programs waive basic courses for
students who have completed similar coursework during their undergraduate
studies. Additional courses depend on your concentration and post-graduate
goals. Be prepared to complete a master's thesis and a capstone project to
complete your degree.
At San Francisco Bay University, the Master of Science in Computer Science
degree program prepares students for the complexities of advanced software
engineering and internet applications. Students acquire knowledge of advanced
design, development, deployment, and integration principles. Once they
graduate, SFBU students gain access to some of the most exclusive high-tech
companies in the area. And with [generous scholarship
options](/admissions/scholarships), consider SFBU as you study for your MSCS
in computer science!
#  How eLearning Benefits Students and Employees
![A female student is working on a portable computer while sitting against the
wide wall](/sites/default/files/2022-06/Thought_Leadership_content.png)
At San Francisco Bay University, we are proud to be located at the epicenter
of technological progress. Bay Area universities and other colleges and
universities in Silicon Valley understand the importance of their location.
That's why we know the power of embracing technology within our teaching
methods and [utilizing
eLearning](https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/newsletters/academic-
update/how-covid-19-changed-the-way-we-teach.html) as one of them. Depending
on their program, our students have the option to study remotely, and doing so
provides them with numerous benefits. Yet, many wonder, is eLearning
beneficial? Do students miss out on anything studying remotely? You may be
surprised to learn the concept of learning remotely goes way, way back.
## Elearning Before There Were Computers
Although the term "eLearning" was first coined in 1999, the process of
teaching someone through programmed learning material was born long before the
turn of the century. In fact, teaching someone via "correspondence" can be
traced all the way back to the 1840s, when an Englishman by the name of Isaac
Pitman offered his shorthand course [via
correspondence](https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=2415).
To this day, this is still considered the first widely adopted practice of
distance education. Yet, eLearning would continue to evolve long before the
first computer.
It was in 1924 that BF Skinner, a Harvard professor, invented what was then
called "[the teaching
machine](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_690062)."
This machine essentially enabled teachers to administer programmed instruction
to their students. It wasn't until 1960 that Donald L. Bitzer at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign introduced a modern-day form of
teaching that combined teaching and computing.
[PLATO](https://www.britannica.com/topic/PLATO-education-system), short for
Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations created one of the first
online communities dedicated to computerized learning and foreshadowed the
development of the internet and future eLearning teaching methodologies.
Although it was not until the 1960s that the first computer-based training
program was introduced, it was these efforts by Isaac Pitman, BF Skinner, and
others that set the stage for a method of teaching now relied upon by
institutions and companies all over the world. Elearning has become widely
accepted by schools, colleges, universities, and companies who want more
efficient and effective ways to teach their students and employees. But
therein lies the question. Is eLearning really efficient and effective?
## The Different Elements of eLearning in Use Today
The world is rapidly moving towards an environment where technological
utilization is becoming the norm. With the ever-increasing number of
technological products, services, and applications changing the way we do
business, communicate, and pass on information, the traditional ways of doing
things are changing. And this includes how teachers and instructors teach and
how students and employees learn. In a traditional classroom setting, an
instructor has information available to them within that setting. Yet
connecting students and employees to the outside world as they learn enhances
their ability to construct and absorb new information.
As a term, eLearning (or E-learning depending on where you look) represents an
umbrella term that refers to a variety of electronic teaching methodologies.
Elearning provides access not only to educational material but also to the
actual process by which the teaching is conducted. Elearning methodologies
include:
  * Virtual classrooms
  * Web-portal learning
  * Digital collaboration
  * Audio and visual recording
  * Interactive teaching
  * Augmented reality
  * Virtual reality
Each new generation becomes evermore comfortable with technology. Thus,
blending technology and learning provides a way for students who are used to
using technology in their everyday lives to better understand the information
being presented. There are so many different methodologies utilized by
eLearning. And they are generally built within learning management systems
(LMS). Learning management systems are very suitable for flexible learning
methods, including "blended learning", which is now so commonplace it has its
own [dictionary definition](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/blended-
learning).
## Aspects of Successful eLearning Programs
Elearning does not happen in a vacuum. When creating a course, managers,
professors, or school administrators must make sure certain criteria are met.
By doing so, they ensure the student or employee benefits fully from the
course they signed up for or are required to take. For instance, the teacher
or instructor must ensure they are available to answer questions or offer
feedback to students. Many might assume one of the drawbacks of eLearning is a
lack of availability when students need their instructors. And this is a
drawback if the course is not properly managed. Students and employees must
have access to their instructors when needed to ensure information is both
received and retained.
As we mentioned before, an effective and user-friendly LMS is absolutely
necessary. Students or employees must be able to easily navigate through and
understand how the LMS works. Course material, tests, evaluations, and scores
must be easily accessible to both students and teachers. In many cases, the
backbone of an organization's network will influence this factor. Company or
university IT departments must ensure internal systems properly support the
LMS in use.
Of course, a class is nothing without effective learning material, and this is
where eLearning shines. Gone are the days when all an instructor had to work
with were books, pens, paper, and a whiteboard. ELearning methodologies
provide instructors with a plethora of tools - whether textual, audio, or
visual - to communicate with and teach their students. And this may be one of
the most important factors of eLearning: communication.
There are many ways, means, devices, tools, apps, and more that allow teachers
and learners to communicate, collaborate, and share information. Whether it be
through interactive multimedia, voice communication, live or prerecorded
videos, digital presentations, or text, eLearning provides students and
teachers with a whole new way to communicate and collaborate with each other.
One university in the Netherlands used a modern LMS to [connect
thousands](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/450417017/How-Dutch-university-
quickly-connected-thousands-of-students-to-new-learning-management-
system?_gl=1*13ajxgg*_ga*ODAzODc4MTIuMTY1MjAxODc1Ng..*_ga_TQKE4GS5P9*MTY1NDg4ODgzNy40LjAuMTY1NDg4ODg1NC4w&_ga=2.218197529.1883922635.1654888837-80387812.1652018756)
of students, resulting in a myriad of benefits for the entire institution.
## How eLearning Benefits Students and Employees
One of the primary benefits of [utilizing
update/how-covid-19-changed-the-way-we-teach.html) methods lies in its
efficiency and flexibility. For example, an informal distribution model of
eLearning is one in which the students or employees can view the course
material, but said material is not used for testing or tracking purposes.
Instead, the material can be accessed as a resource. This method is used
primarily where blended learning is used.
More formal models of eLearning (and more often used) are those in which
instructors keep track of and make recordings of how well their students are
learning and retaining information. This is important for academic
institutions like SFBU. Professors must have specific systems and standards in
place to ensure the scores their students receive accurately reflect the level
of learning and knowledge retention expected of them. In most cases,
institutions and companies utilize learning management systems to provide and
verify instruction.
Today, many colleges, universities, and companies of all shapes and sizes
offer off-premise eLearning simply because it has so many advantages over
traditional learning systems. Just a few of these include:
  * **Flexibility** : Learners can access material at any time and at their own pace.
  * **Scope** : Learners generally have access to thousands of online courses and information stored onsite or in the cloud. Companies using eLearning methods can upload policies, procedures, and other company-centric documents accessed with a click of a button.
  * **Cost** : Since universities and companies don't have to bring students or employees into the classroom, eLearning often results in a cost reduction for students, institutions, and businesses. It's a win-win-win.
  * **Consistency** : Teachers in a classroom present information in different ways. Elearning allows students to receive the same information in the same format every time a course is accessed.
We live in a fast-paced, technology-oriented world, and both students and
employees want to know that the universities and companies they associate with
offer cutting-edge teaching methodologies, of which eLearning is one. For
many, eLearning is considered to be one of the defining methods of presenting
and acquiring knowledge in the 21st century.
#  SFBU's Favorite Bay Area Beaches
![Two female students are chatting happily](/sites/default/files/2022-08/Bay-
Area-Beaches-content.jpeg)
San Francisco Bay University is situated in an exceptional location: Fremont,
California. After all, we are still the closest East Bay city to the high-tech
Silicon Valley network of businesses, and as such we have access to a strong
tech industry presence. We all know that those in the tech industry live by a
common motto; they indeed work hard, with [30% of surveyed tech
workers](https://knowtechie.com/according-to-a-new-survey-31-of-tech-workers-
only-work-about-three-hours-per-day) admitting they work between seven and ten
hours per day, but they like to play hard too. And the same goes for SFBU
students. As a San Francisco Area university, we have plenty of "play hard"
options. As an East Bay university, we have access to
[restaurants](/blog/alumni/sfbu-restaurant-and-eateries-guide) and bars of all
shapes and sizes. And yet, what if a little more relaxation time is what you
seek?
Well, that's where the beaches come in. Colleges and universities in San
Francisco have access to some of the most beautiful beaches on the West Coast.
Someone once said, "The West Coast is the Best Coast" and we couldn't agree
more. And yet, when you picture a typical California beach in your mind, you
are likely to think of sun-drenched Southern California, from Santa Monica
Pier to Dana Point. And yet, the beaches here in San Francisco have a charm
all their own. San Francisco Area university students and locals from all over
the area have a plethora of beautiful beaches to choose from. Which ones are
your favorites? Here, we introduce you to what we consider to be three of the
more notable beaches in the San Francisco Bay Area.
## 1\. [Montara State Beach](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=532)
You might think we would start with one of the more busy and popular options,
like Ocean Beach or Baker Beach, but we wanted to deliver some more insider
information instead. Let's visit some beaches students who aren't from the
local area may never have heard of. So, first, we'll head a half hour's drive
outside of San Francisco to Montara State Beach, a lesser-known beach that
boasts magnificent views of the Pacific Ocean. Make sure to bring your hiking
shoes, however, as the path down to the beach can be a little gnarly. But due
to its location and rugged entrance, it is one of the cleanest and most
secluded beaches that San Francisco area university students have access to.
Even better, the waters around the beach are part of a protected marine
recreation area. For those who like to plan ahead, visit sometime between
March and June and you may be lucky enough to spot humpback whales as they
begin moving closer to shore! Restaurants and grocery stores are located
nearby in the towns of Montara and Moss Beach. Point Montara Lighthouse offers
overnight accommodations and McNee Ranch encompasses a coastal mountain range
with well-manicured trails and beautiful views of the Pacific Ocean.
## 2\. [Agate Beach Park](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-
activities/beaches-in-marin-county/agate-beach-park/)
Located a short drive north of San Francisco proper near Bolinas, Agate Beach
Park is definitely one for all you nature-loving SFBU students out there. This
beach is a drone photographer's dream, with turquoise blue and green waters
surrounding picturesque rocky outcroppings. And with almost two miles of ocean
shoreline and a 6.6-acre park, there is plenty to see and do. When the tide is
low, beautiful tidepools appear ready for exploration.
Even better, tidepools aren't the only beautiful things to explore at Agate
Beach Park. Expect to see birdwatchers looking for up to [73 different bird
species](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=6aec9dec129b7fd85b3c97b494e606ed3c72eb9ccea73c5d99accedaf3202844JmltdHM9MTY1NjM2ODc2MiZpZ3VpZD03NWZjNjk0MC03MThlLTQ3ZmItOGRjOS0zZmI2YjRkZTYzOGYmaW5zaWQ9NTM5Nw&ptn=3&fclid=2028d82b-f668-11ec-a79e-346161948a4a&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnBzLmdvdi9hZ2ZvL2xlYXJuL25hdHVyZS9iaXJkcy5odG0jOn46dGV4dD1CaXJkcyUyMGFyZSUyMHRoZSUyMG1vc3QlMjB2aXNpYmxlJTIwdHlwZSUyMG9mJTIwd2lsZGxpZmUsd29vZCUyMGR1Y2slMjBhcmUlMjBvbmx5JTIwcHJlc2VudCUyMGR1cmluZyUyMHRoZSUyMHN1bW1lci4&ntb=1),
from the ring neck pheasant to the sharp-tailed grouse. The secluded nature of
Agate Beach Park also means you might even catch a glimpse of a sea lion or
two sunning itself on one of the many rocky outcroppings dotting the
shoreline.
## 3\. [Kiteboard Beach](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-
After taking you away from our local area to some lesser-known beaches, we
wanted to bring it home and introduce you to a beach for SFBU students who are
looking for an adrenaline rush. Welcome to Kiteboard Beach. While Kiteboard
Beach is approximately 18 miles away in San Mateo, for those looking for good
wind and surf, Kiteboard Beach is an excellent option. We know there are
plenty of San Francisco area university students out there who are avid
thrill-seekers.
For those who want to test their skills, summer is the perfect time for
kiting, whether on land or water, in Santa Cruz and San Francisco's Bay Area.
While Kiteboard Beach is the closest, there are excellent kiteboarding spots
all up and down the coastline. But if you also want to just chill and enjoy
the sounds of the surf, that is also an option. Just always be careful of the
rough ocean currents and riptides that swirl around Kiteboard Beach.
We understand these beaches are a bit of a trek, but we wanted to introduce
SFBU students to something more off the beaten path. But if you're looking for
something a little closer to home, here are some other top beaches in the Bay
Area:
  * Ocean Beach
  * Baker Beach
  * China Beach
  * Davenport Beach
  * Mile Rock Beach
  * Marshall's Beach
  * ... and more!
The beauty of living in the San Francisco Bay Area is that we've got a lot to
choose from. There's no shortage of beautiful beaches for SFBU students to
choose from. All you need to do is pick one, pack up, and head out. And
speaking of packing up...
## San Francisco Area University Students' Beach Checklist
Before you make your way to one of these beautiful beaches, make sure to set a
checklist for yourself. The last thing you want is to head to the beach
unprepared. Here are some helpful tips to ensure you have a great time on the
beach.
  * **Find Shade** : One of the first rules of beachgoing is to get there early so you can get a shady spot. Or you can bring a beach umbrella or shade tent. Whatever works to keep the sun's rays from cooking you.
  * **Bring a Mesh Bag** : You may be tempted to bring a tote or dry bag for all your goodies, whether towels, speakers, flotation devices, or otherwise, but consider the humidity. Mesh bags prevent mold and allow for proper airflow.
  * **Bring Bug Spray** : For those visiting any of these beaches early in the morning, bug spray is a must. Whether it be mosquitoes, sand flies, beach hoppers, or other insects, swarms of them can cast a serious pall on your otherwise calm and serene beach day.
  * **Follow the Rules** : Remember that it is against the law to consume alcohol in California state parks. Also, make sure to pay attention to where lifeguards are and look for guidance if you are unsure of whether or not the water is safe.
  * **Watch for Rip Tides** : The one thing Southern California beaches have on their neighbors to the north is calmer waters. Beaches around the Bay Area tend to be rougher and a bit more dangerous, with more rip tides and strong currents.
We hope you've enjoyed this romp through some of the best and most notable
beaches in the San Francisco Bay Area. Are you a student from out of state or
overseas reading this and wishing you could be attaining a world-class
education and lounging on some of Northern California's most beautiful
beaches? If so, contact our [admissions office](/admissions) today!

bill, going to college or attending university requires a certain level of
financial responsibility.
At the same time, we don't want you to worry. Sure, it will be important to
budget properly. Maybe you'll have to forgo that awesome new pair of kicks to
ensure your new university bills get paid. Or maybe not! If you create a sound
budget and act with fiscal responsibility, there is no reason why you can't

college earning potential. A higher education is always worth the cost.
## What Are the Base Undergraduate and Graduate Costs to Attend SFBU?

For more information on tuition and costs, including a chart providing more
cost breakdowns with tuition assistance included, [click or tap here
](https://sfbu.edu/admissions/tuition) and head to our tuition and costs page.
## Tuition Assistance and Scholarships for Students
SFBU is proud to offer classes at a lower price point than universities with
similar programs. We're also proud to offer tuition grants for up to 75% of
your tuition costs. Our tuition grants offer big savings for students who need
assistance paying for school. For example, for a master's degree without
tuition assistance, you would pay an estimated $21,636. With a 75% tuition
grant, you can expect to pay around $9,486.
Not only does SFBU offer tuition assistance to those who qualify, we offer
scholarships as well. In general, scholarships are awarded based upon various
criteria, such as academic merit, diversity and inclusion, athletic skill, and
financial need.
While scholarship and tuition grant recipients are not required to repay
scholarships or grants, the awards may require that the recipient continue to
meet certain requirements while they are in class, such as maintaining a
minimum grade point average or engaging in a certain activity. Scholarships
may provide a monetary award, an in-kind award, or a combination. Let's have a
closer look at the scholarships SFBU offers. At the end of the section we will
provide a link you can use to look at scholarship requirements in greater
detail.
Students can apply for a few different types of President's Scholarships at
SFBU. First, students based in California can apply for a President's
Scholarship for California Community College transfer students. The most
important aspect of this scholarship is that to take advantage of it, you must
have earned an associates degree or obtained a minimum of 60 transferable
credits at a California community college. Transferable credits must be
counted towards a bachelor's degree requirement. SFBU offers President's
Scholarships for those seeking a Bachelor's or Master's Degree. These
scholarships cover 100% of your tuition provided you meet certain
SFBU also offers scholarships that cover both tuition and housing. These are
popular for students who want to both live in campus-provided housing and
receive tuition assistance. Housing is limited, so the housing scholarship is
contingent on housing availability, but if awarded the student receives
housing assistance for a period of two consecutive semesters and 100% tuition
assistance as well.
There are a limited number of scholarships available, so early applications
are highly recommended. You remember the old saying, "The early bird gets the
worm!" Consider this an accurate axiom when applying for a scholarship. You
don't want to miss out on it simply because you did not apply in time.
Did you know we currently have 62 students benefiting from one of our
scholarships? This could certainly be you if you qualify. Right now we have 15
students utilizing the Housing Scholarship, 13 using the President's
Scholarship, and 34 getting 75% of their tuition paid through one of our
Tuition Grants. These students are seeing real-world savings. And when you see
them walking around campus with that new pair of kicks, you will understand
why.

type of scholarship, simply [ click or tap

## Other Costs Associated with Attending a California University
Attending a college or university in Northern California comes with costs
outside of what you pay to the university. Sure, you've got to cover tuition
and housing (if you don't get a scholarship), but there are other costs that
you might not have considered. Many are associated with simply living! From
computers to clothes - this is stuff you need regardless.
Consider technology and electronics. Electronics are one of the most expensive
and commonly purchased items for college or university students. You don't
want a nice laptop just for that latest video game. You want to quickly and
easily get around files and complete assignments. Students can expect to
spend[ $262 on average ](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-
colleges/paying-for-college/slideshows/10-college-costs-other-than-tuition-
and-housing) on electronics.
We've been talking about those shoes, so why not expand on that. Clothes are
not cheap and you will need them as you work towards your degree. What's the
breakdown on clothes and shoes? [Around
$148.37](https://spendmenot.com/blog/college-student-spending-statistics/) per
month. Obviously, we know San Franciscans are stylish and the city isn't
cheap, so you could probably add another twenty bucks to that.
Transportation will have to be another cost you consider. Especially since
there are so may awesome activities in the Bay area! Whether you are a local
with a vehicle or come from another country, getting around is important, and
the costs associated are necessary expenses. Transportation costs can run up
to [ $1,200 per year](https://spendmenot.com/blog/college-student-spending-
statistics/), depending on the modes or method of transportation you use.
Here are some other associated costs or expenses you can expect as a college
student:
  * Food
  * Utilities
  * Cell phone and service
As you can see, there are plenty of costs associated with attending a
university. At SFBU, our goal is to ensure our students have the resources
they need to succeed. There is certainly some measure of financial learning
that comes from getting a degree. We are here to help you along your
educational and financial journey, however, you need us. Contact us today to

#  A Closer Look at the Pros and Cons of a Bachelor in Business Administration
![Smiling businessman with colleagues in
Unless you live deep within the Amazon jungle, then no matter where you are in
the world, companies are there keeping the wheels of commerce greased.
Consider America alone, and you're looking at [32.5
million](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sbo.html) small business
owners. Now also consider that 99.9% of all companies in the U.S. are small
businesses and the scale of commerce in America becomes clear.
The fact is businesses generate jobs and opportunities. Businesses still
operate even in countries that do not use capitalism as their primary economic
system. Trade is going to happen no matter what. The real question comes down
to how people settle trades. How do they conduct business? What do individuals
need to succeed in business? Would a bachelor in business administration
degree benefit you?
## The Pros of a Bachelor in Business Administration
Consider that people pay a lot of money and take a lot of time to get a
degree. Surely, they are all good for something. Right? Well, wrong. Not every
degree is useful. But why not? Because you've got to obtain a degree that is
practical for whatever career you choose. Consider an [online bachelor's
degree in business administration](/blog/prospective/sfbu-now-offers-class-
online). No matter what company, industry, or business you operate in, a
business degree carries high esteem the world over. Both practical and
challenging, a bachelor's in business administration provides you with the
real-world skills that today's employers demand.
One of the most important parts of embarking on a new career is marketability.
While you may be absolutely fantastic at what you do, how do potential
employers or clients know that? A bachelor's degree in business administration
can provide you with the skills and knowledge that 21st-century companies look
for. And just consider for a moment everything modern day businesses must deal
with. From cybersecurity to artificial intelligence (AI), gone are the days
when problems were simple and analog. That's why a university's comprehensive
business program covers a wide array of topics.
When you enroll in a bachelor of business administration degree program,
you'll receive a broad business education - including the fundamentals of
accounting, finance, operations, marketing, and more - that can distinguish
you from your peers. But you can also specialize your major. At SFBU, we are
surrounded by [reputable companies](/blog/alumni/dominates_for_high-tech_Jobs)
who hire business administration specialists all the time.
## Majors Associated with a Business Administration Degree
When someone refers to a business administration degree, they are generally
talking about a bachelor's degree in a specific area of business. Most
university bachelor of business programs in the United States may be more
general, focusing on a broad range of business functions and how they interact
with one another. Or they may be more specialized, exploring in greater depth
a singular area of business.
Generalist business degrees may be in areas such as business administration or
business management. Those enrolled in a generalist business programs obtain a
diverse set of skills and are trained well enough to work in any industry.
Through elective courses, business students can place more emphasis in
specialized areas such as marketing or finance.
We examined the following business majors based on the [Bureau of Labor
Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/home.htm) data for
average annual salary and expected job growth over the next 10 years.
  * Accounting
  * Business Administration
  * Economics
  * Entrepreneurship
  * Finance
  * Forensic Accounting
  * Hospitality Management
  * Human Resources
  * International Business
  * Internet Marketing
  * Management
  * Management Information Systems
  * Marketing
  * Non-Profit Management
  * Project Management
  * Retail & Sales Management
  * Small Business
  * Sports Management
  * Supply Chain & Logistics
## Are There a Lot of Career Opportunities for Business Administration
Graduates?
No matter what you choose, each of these business major options can open the
door to rewarding and lucrative career opportunities. You might be surprised
to learn that quite a few high-demand career options have a business
administration component. They include:
  * **Health Services Manager** : As a medical or health services manager you work behind the scenes at a hospital, doctor's office, or another care facility. Your job is to keep it running safely and efficiently. You manage many operational duties of a health care facility from training to retention.
  * **Human Resources Specialist/Manager** : The role of the human resources specialist contributes to the wellbeing and development of an organization's most precious asset, its people. This provides many opportunities for personal and professional growth and the development of both hard and soft people skills. HR jobs are commonly listed as one of the best business specialties to study.
  * **Marketing Manager** : As a marketing manager you serve as the link between a company and its customers. You will either work on, with, or manage a public relations or marketing team. The job may include managing budgets, testing market strategies, and monitoring key performance indicators and trends.
We choose these three examples to demonstrate the breadth of career options
available to someone studying for their bachelor of business administration in
the United States and around the world. Whether it be in the medical field, as
an HR generalist, or in marketing, you can generally find a job in just about
any industry or vertical with nothing more than a bachelor's degree in
business administration.
## Is a Bachelor's in Business Administration from SFBU Right for You?
Prospective students evaluating whether they should get a bachelor's degree
should consider the benefits, especially if the degree is in business. These
include a higher potential income, increased job prospects, and new and
enriching life experiences. If you've been working for a while, a bachelor's
degree may also help you launch a new career or advance in your current one.
And then, of course, obtaining a bachelor's can be the first step to getting a
higher academic degree, like a master's or a doctorate.
Students typically need at least 120 credits to graduate from a bachelor's in
business administration program in the US. Credits are acquired by passing
classes for your major and other courses the school might require. College
degrees generally take between four and five years to complete when you're
enrolled full-time, but they can take longer or shorter depending on the
program you enroll in and the number of classes you take each year. This is
where you must ask yourself whether you have the time, funds, and desire to
study business.
Are you ready to talk to someone about your future? Are you wondering if your
career of choice is perfect for a bachelor in business administration degree?

#  Application Series: How to Apply to SFBU's Undergraduate Program
![Two female students are chatting
happily](/sites/default/files/2022-06/application_content.png)
After completing high school, many young people find themselves at a
crossroads. With a job market as hot as the one we have today, there are
plenty of options. Employers added nearly [half-a-million
workers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-06/normalizing-but-
not-back-to-normal-the-u-s-job-market-in-2022) at the end of 2021 alone, and
2022 is shaping up to be another gangbusters year for those seeking
employment. So, what's a student to do once they graduate? Well, one thing
they could do is apply to an undergraduate computer science program in
California. Why? Because California is home to the highest cluster of hi-tech
companies in the world.
Research shows that getting a college degree vastly improves your chances of
landing the job you want and increases your money-making potential. According
to the [U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2020/data-on-display/education-
pays.htm), getting a degree increases your median usual weekly earnings.
That's why most students, upon completing high school, consider pursuing a
college degree. And completing your undergraduate degree not only helps you
land a great job and increase your earning potential, it also helps you build
a strong educational foundation, improve your technical skills, and prepare
you for the career of your dreams. Still, you need to make sure the
undergraduate degree you choose is right for you and learn what it entails.
## What is an Undergraduate Degree and What Does it Require?
An undergraduate degree is a bachelor's degree. They are one and the same. An
undergraduate degree is a credential you receive when you complete a course of
study at a college or university. Here at San Francisco Bay University, we
offer undergraduate degrees in the following disciplines:
  * [Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA)](/academics/school-of-business/bsba)
  * [Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS)](/academics/school-of-engineering/bscs)
If you are considering a college degree, you might be thinking about getting a
graduate degree. Undergraduate and graduate degrees both offer key credentials
but have distinct requirements and outcomes. Undergraduate programs usually
require students to complete high school and take college entrance exams like
the SAT or the ACT exam. They may also require personal essays, reference
letters, and interviews.
Most bachelor's degree programs are designed to take students four years to
complete. Undergraduate students usually take dozens of courses that cover
their main area of study and provide basic education in areas like math,
science, language, and culture. Requirements may vary depending on the degree.
To earn an undergraduate degree, students must complete the required courses
and ensure they achieve a minimum grade point average. Once an undergraduate
degree has been obtained, students will generally be qualified for entry- or
mid-level careers of their choice, or they can move on to apply for graduate
programs. As we mentioned before, earning a bachelor's degree can qualify you
for jobs in many industries and greatly increase your earning potential. But
before a prospective student can even apply for an undergraduate degree, they
must complete the steps required to be accepted.
## How to Apply to the SFBU Undergraduate Program
Here at SFBU, our goal is to assist new students in embarking on their journey
to obtain a bachelor's degree in a discipline of their choosing. We assist
through every step of the process, whether it be explaining admission
requirements or even just learning more about the institution. We also accept
students from community colleges interested in obtaining a four-year degree.
To apply for an undergraduate computer science program in California - one
offered by SFBU - prospective students need to complete specific steps. These
steps are the same for those seeking an undergraduate degree in business or
computer science.
There are four essential steps involved in applying for your undergraduate
program. They include:
  * Review the requirements below, depending on whether you are local, international, transfer-in, or change of status (see below).
  * Create your [SFBU Applicant Portal](https://my.sfbu.edu/Account/Logon?enc=td2nmreLJyypG4lX9oxb4loYfZujQFCgHQ8+m5OArT2gsrXBWqLJa/xG1l8vBXie) account.
  * Submit your application.
  * Submit your official documents.
There are four different potential student categories who apply for an
undergraduate degree:
  * [Local Undergraduate Applicant](/admissions/undergraduate/local)
  * [Change of Status (COS) Applicant](/admissions/undergraduate/cos)
It is important to consider that your application deadlines are different
depending on what semester you apply for. Here are the deadlines depending on
the type of student you enter as. They are:
Semester | Deadline  
(International and COS) | Deadline  
(Local & Transfer-in)  
There are also specific Tuition Deposit Deadlines students must keep in mind,
depending on where they apply from. To secure your seat after admission, the
following deadlines must be considered:
Official documents you must gather as part of the application process include:
  * SFBU Application: Simple questions and personal details.
  * High School and/or College Grades or Transcripts: If you are a foreign student, ensure these documents are translated into English.
  * Identification Documentation: This includes an ID card or driver's license for local students or a passport for international students so that SFBU can issue you a Form I-20 upon admission.
  * Motivation and/or Reference Letters: You will need to provide letters of reference to show that you are suitable for an undergraduate program at SFBU.
The basic rule of applying for an undergraduate university program is to apply
as soon as possible. The sooner you apply, the better, as you have a greater
chance of getting your materials together and ensuring acceptance. Early
applications also provide you with greater chances of getting a [scholarship
or tuition assistance](/admissions/scholarships) if you choose to apply for
either.
Colleges and universities in the bay area are competitive. Whether you are
applying for an undergraduate program in California or otherwise, the
university system here has a lot to offer, from computer science programs and
business programs to engineering programs and more. That's why we want to make
sure you are comfortable in your journey. You can either schedule an admission
information session and [plan a visit](/admissions/information-sessions) or

#  SFBU Now Offers Class Online
![Distance Learning. Happy  male student is studying online With Laptop And
San Francisco Bay University is now proud to offer classes online! Similar to
attending a physical campus and learning in person, there are specific pros
and cons to learning within a virtual classroom setting. But online learning
is here to stay. Companies must reskill to meet the demands of a modern and
remote workforce. In fact, according to the [Future of Jobs Report
2020](https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-future-of-jobs-report-2020/digest),
84% percent of employers are set to rapidly digitalize working processes,
including a significant expansion of remote work--with the potential to move
44% of their workforce to operate remotely. With so many people working
remotely, online education in its many forms is here to stay. And like many
other universities in San Francisco, California, we are glad to bring online
classes to our student body.
## What Classes Does SFBU Offer Online?
It is important that you evaluate the [pros and cons of online
learning](https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/newsletters/academic-
update/how-covid-19-changed-the-way-we-teach.html) before you make your
choice. Students should feel comfortable in the knowledge that what is covered
in an in-person class is also covered in an online course. There is no
appreciable difference between a degree earned in person and one earned
online. If you are intrigued by the possibilities online learning opens up,
consider the classes offered by San Francisco Bay University. Universities in
San Francisco, California are held to a higher standard. You can expect the
same level of rigorous learning and top-notch professors online as you have
come to expect in person.
Most of the degree programs we offer here at SFBU are offered in the online
modality. That includes:
  * [Bachelor's in Science Business Administration (BSBA) ](/academics/school-of-business/bsba)
  * [Master of Business Administration (MBA) ](/academics/school-of-business/mba)
  * [Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) ](/academics/school-of-engineering/mscs)
It is important for students to schedule a session with our admissions office
to verify that they meet all the eligibility requirements for online classes.
While all classes in the online approved degree programs are available in
theory, SFBU only offers a specific set of classes during each semester, so
not all classes are available at all times. A quick discussion with one of our
admissions counselors will determine which classes are available for online
learning and when.
## Why Are Online Classes Important?
Among some of the many benefits of online learning, students who take classes
online enjoy the more flexible nature of online learning. Taking online
classes allows students who want to start working right away to develop their
careers right alongside their education. The increased flexibility that comes
with a lack of a commute is tangible. And students attending universities in
San Francisco, California know traffic can be a real nightmare. The time saved
not having to drive to school is significant.
Online classes also save students both time and money. First, if a student
travels from another location to campus, they are losing time in the commute.
Online classes allow students to log into their classes without the hassle of
a long commute. Second, online classes save students money. According to data
updated August, 2021, students who commute to a college or university in San
Francisco, California - or beyond - pay on average $3,400 a year in
transportation costs.
Still, online learning may not be for everyone. It certainly requires a
dedicated mindset. Staying on-task and being self-motivated are both critical
factors to ensuring you not only succeed but excel in your online classes. And
the added flexibility that comes with online learning can be a double-edged
sword without proper discipline. It's important for students to carefully
weigh the advantages and disadvantages of online learning before they make the
decision to switch to virtual classes.
## What Are the Benefits of Online Learning?
We already talked about the benefits of flexible learning, but let's dive a
little deeper into that topic. Virtual classrooms are great for people who are
working and going to school. When attending virtual classes, students have a
lot more autonomy in their schedule by cutting out the commute and saving time
on in-person requirements. When you have more control over your schedule, it
becomes easier to avoid distractions.
Keeping a flexible learning schedule provides you with more free time. The
extra time you gain from taking classes online can be used any way you want,
whether it be for more time studying, focusing on your career, or spending
more time with your family. When all you need is an internet connection and a
laptop or tablet, more effective learning can be found right at your
fingertips.
Another important distinction in online learning is the increased levels of
collaboration students are exposed to. When students have more flexibility,
they have more time for virtual group work sessions and meetings. Most
universities in San Francisco, California, and other states, offer message
boards and grouping tools for their students. This allows the online student
body to post feedback on their readings and assignments and respond to and
interact with other classmates and teachers.
Online learning allows for more personalized education. Teachers who teach
classes online also have more free time. Students benefit from teachers who
can spend more time with them. Students who aren't as assertive might find
more opportunities to participate in class when they are not collaborating
with people in an in-person environment. Professors also have more time to
spend one-on-one with students, addressing their specific needs.
Are you ready to start your journey through higher education in an online
learning environment? Let SFBU guide you through the process and determine
whether virtual learning is right for you! And in the meantime, to help your

#  SFBU's Restaurant and Eateries Guide in Fremont, Silicon Valley, and
Beyond!
![Restaurants in
Fremont](/sites/default/files/2022-06/Fremont_Restaurants_content.png)
As a Bay Area university, we understand how special our home is. San Francisco
Bay University is situated where the apex of art, culture, technology, and
cuisine come together. SFBU is proud to be part of such a thriving community.
The culinary opportunities are ripe in the area around Fremont, California -
an area filled with California universities and colleges, technology
companies, and more. Imagine the possibilities not just for SFBU students, but
for parents, friends, family, and other visitors. From hamburgers to Michelin
Stars, we've got it all.
Still, what if you're an SFBU student not necessarily looking for the next
Michelin Star or three? Maybe you just want to eat somewhere good and close to
campus. Time is of the essence in your studies. That's why we wanted to
balance our list not just with excellent culinary opportunities but also with
places that are close to campus and easily accessible. Of course, we want to
give our local businesses here in Fremont, California some love. But still,
let's take a small trip around San Francisco and the Bay Area.
## Why is the San Francisco Bay Area a Culinary Capital?
People usually talk about New York and Los Angeles. Go to Paris they say. But
there are currently [115
options](https://guide.michelin.com/en/us/california/san-
francisco/restaurants) on the Michelin Star San Francisco List. There is a LOT
of good food in the Bay Area. San Francisco has become known as a culinary
destination for good reason. Northern California is a beautiful destination
and a perfect place to create culinary expressions of taste and presentation.
When you live in the San Francisco Bay Area, you know good food. The standard
for fine dining excellence can be found right here. San Francisco restaurants
are on the cutting edge of not just food preparation, but food design. The Bay
Area is a place where gastronomy meets cuisine. Restaurants like [Atelier
Crenn](https://www.ateliercrenn.com/) set the standard for Bay Area innovation
in dining and are still there creating delicious dishes for lucky diners.
Other San Francisco legends perfect for a partner or visiting parents include
[Nopa](http://nopasf.com/) and [Ryoko's](https://www.ryokos.com/home).
Northern California is home to some of the country's best wineries, the most
fertile agricultural land, and the highest-quality seafood and meats. The
restaurants with access to these treasures of land and sea create amazing
things out of them. And it is they who have put San Francisco on the map as
the cuisine capital of the country. Yet, there is more to San Francisco than
Michelin Stars. Here, students attending colleges and universities in Fremont
and the surrounding areas want to know where to eat. Maybe they don't want to
trek into town for a Michelin Star. Let's get local.
## A Bay Area University Beyond the Bay
We like to say "We are the bay." But we are also a university beyond the Bay.
And we mean that in a metaphorical sense. We are a part of the Bay Area, but
we are in an area of our own. We are in Silicon Valley. There is an entirely
different scene here and SFBU students can feel it. Whether seeking a
U.S.-based education from another country or from the local area - attending
university in Fremont is a different feeling.
And with that different feeling comes different culinary opportunities. When
you talk about eating in Fremont, San Jose, or other areas, people wonder,
[what's going on food-wise](https://theculturetrip.com/north-
america/usa/california/articles/the-10-best-restaurants-in-downtown-san-jose/)
in the tech suburb? Well, quite a lot actually. Indeed, if San Jose has any
distinguishing characteristic, it's that it is, far and away, the Bay Area's
greatest immigrant food city.
Don't let the tech-heavy narrative of the Silicon Valley area drown out the
culinary identity of the place. Food hubs like the predominantly Mexican and
Vietnamese enclaves of East San Jose came into being, in large part, because
those neighborhoods were the only areas in San Jose where working-class
immigrants and refugees could afford to live and open businesses.
It is also important to consider geographic proximity. Many of these small
neighborhoods were so close together that a lot of the immigrant children who
lived there went to school together, became friends, married, and intermingled
their cuisine. This led to a vibrant fusion cuisine scene in the San Jose
area, and it shows.
## Top Tips for SFBU Students Looking for Eats in the Area
First, consider some of the [Best of Fremont options in
2021](https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/fremonttribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/1b/b1b6e7b8-d444-11eb-9d70-1fcf261b4beb/60d368fae6f8f.pdf.pdf)!
Although Fremont is part of the Silicon Valley area, we do have our own
distinct flavor and lifestyle here. Each year the Best of Fremont list puts
together some of the highlights of our hometown.
Otherwise, there are some quite decent places around the university students
can choose from to get a quick, healthy, and tasty meal. We did an internal
poll here of SFBU employees and admissions staff to figure out the places we
like and would be happy to recommend to our students. Here's where we would
recommend if you want a good bite to eat in the area:
[**Paris Baguette**](https://www.parisbaguette.com/): We found this to be a
great option for someone seeking a sweet treat or a pastry on the go. They are
a local bakery that tries to provide a personal feel. To them, pastries aren't
just a product, they are their passion. They have bakers, cakes, and baristas
serving up freshly-baked loaves of bread, delicious coffee, and cakes more
than worthy of SFBU students' standards.
[**Sala Thai**](https://salathairestaurants.com/): This one was on more than a
few internal lists. Not only is Sala Thai only a couple of blocks from the
school, but it's also one of the better Thai options in the area. Because Thai
food isn't hard to come by. It's great Thai food that stands out, and Sala
Thai is pretty great. Students can eat in or order take-out and can expect
fast service and affordable prices.
[Chaat Bhavan](https://www.chaatbhavan.com/): While we are going around the
world with recommendations, we figured why not take students to India! Even
better, Chaat Bhavan specializes in vegetarian food. For students who are a
bit more discerning in terms of the meat they do or don't eat, this option is
just for them!
Fremont California is, of course, a vibrant city with lots of options.
Students attending a Bay Area university here, whether SFBU or otherwise, have
plenty of restaurants to choose from. Whether it be a delicious In-n-Out
burger or a hot-fudge sundae from McDonald's, all the options [are right
here](https://www.google.com/maps/search/restaurants+in+fremont+california/@37.5365055,-122.0060279,13z/data=!3m1!4b1)!
#  Top 3 Networking Tips for New University Graduates
![A male is smiling and talking to a group of
people](/sites/default/files/2022-11/Networking-Tips-content.jpeg)
Networking can sometimes feel forced, contrived, or simply transactional. And
for newly graduated university students making their way in the world, that
can make it awkward or nerve-wracking to meet people and make new connections.
New graduates from a top university in San Francisco usually want to find a
high-paying tech job right out of school and in many cases, they need help
doing it. Fortunately, it isn't hard to get the help they need with the proper
networking methodology. Networking does not need to feel daunting. Building a
network to help you on your career journey can be intimidating, but knowing
how to approach professionals and build connections is a powerful tool to help
you find the perfect career.
According to analytics put together by a LinkedIn research team, in 2020,
students from four-year colleges with successful job hunts averaged [114.5 new
connections](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/theres-art-career-networking-new-
college-data-provides-george-anders) during that full, year-long period. This
represented a 17% increase from their connection rate in 2019 when we were
living in pre-COVID times. In a remote work environment, graduating students
may feel more pressure than ever before to ensure that they find and network
with the right people.
Every successful business person or ambitious employee has various beneficial
relationships. Not only does it help them find job opportunities or hire
industrious and capable people, but it also helps them maintain their success.
That's why we've put together a helpful list of five essential networking tips
to help students successfully navigate the post-graduation landscape. These
are important considerations as students finish their studies and plot their
initial career moves.
## 1\. Use Age as an Asset
Right after high school or college graduation, students may have a
comparatively undeveloped reputation. And while their youth viewed through the
lens of experience may be a liability, it is an asset when viewed through the
prism of productivity, motivation, and longevity. Young professionals are
eager to show themselves as an asset to the organization. Finding a good job
and keeping it can be tough in an unstable world with constantly changing
economic conditions. As such, young workers tend to show a high level of
motivation and productivity. And graduates from top universities in San
Francisco already know the environment in Silicon Valley is tough.
It is also important to remember that people are less understanding later on
in one's career. There will be certain expectations of workers as they mature
and gather experience. So it is important that they leverage their moments in
youth to network, make friends, and establish relationships. Networking events
are beneficial, as are trips to the local coffee shop. One should be outgoing
and shouldn't be afraid to introduce their talents or talk about who they are
and what they want to do. Science has proven that it's [harder to make
friends](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/psychology-relationships-adult-
friends.html) and network as you get older. In this case, one shouldn't let
youth be wasted on the young.
## 2\. Make Friends and Establish Bonds
While some may [point out
differences](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2012/08/06/the-difference-
between-networking-and-making-friends/), it can be said that networking is
really nothing more than making friends, establishing bonds, and creating
relationships. Whether it is with people in a school, work, or home
environment - as one networks effectively, friends are made. For those who
have landed a job in their chosen profession but want to make connections, a
natural way to network is simply to make friends with co-workers and employees
at other companies in their field at various events.
The relationships one makes as they make friends and network can ultimately be
more valuable than the relationships made at their job as they climb the
ladder. Their peers can be the first ones to think of them when there's a job
opening, the ones to help them or give them ideas if they encounter some
professional dilemma and they have no idea what to do. Personal and
professional peers should be ignored at one's peril. These relationships can
be just as important as any others.
Young people are [disproportionately
impacted](https://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/en/data-insights/young-people-and-
women-hit-hard-by-jobs-crisis) by economic crises. And in many cases, they
know. As a result, they have a higher level of awareness when it comes to the
relationships they create. The people one invests in can play a big role in
the overall trajectory of their life.
## 3\. Take Advantage of Opportunities at Events
It's easy to sign up for networking events for the sake of signing up for
networking events. One shouldn't do a thing simply because one can. Careful
thought and consideration must go into post-academic career planning. And
events should be a part of that planning. The whole purpose of events,
conventions, and meet-ups is to bring people together. Aspiring, recently-
graduated career professionals should take full advantage of the opportunities
afforded at networking events and other professional get-togethers.
Yet, rather than leveraging these opportunities, many people sign up for an
event only to find themselves wandering aimlessly through a deserted
networking wilderness. Don't sign up for networking events willy-nilly. The
only events that deserve attention are ones that provide legitimate employment
or other career-advancing opportunities. Sign up for events attended by
desirable employers that are looking to hire people, especially the newly-
graduated. One should focus more of their time on what connections they can
build through their existing relationships (friends of friends, friends of
parents, family friends, etc.). And here at SFBU, we put a focus on helping
our students find and maintain healthy relationships
We are proud to offer an [alumni portal](https://alumni.sfbu.edu/) that
contains links to all sorts of events. One can also find links to the various
alumni clubs, such as the Easy English club. We also routinely advertise
community events right on the front home page of our website. For more

#  How to Prepare and Apply for a Scholarship in 4 Easy Steps
![Scholarship](/sites/default/files/2022-06/scholarships_content.png)
Welcome to the San Francisco Bay University's Scholarship Series, where we
dive deep into the hows and whys of scholarships and the opportunities they
present. For instance, one question a student will be able to answer by the
end of our series is how to get a computer science scholarship at a university
in the USA! But more than telling you how to apply for it, we are going to
advise you on the best ways to prepare. How will you stand out amongst your
peers?
Did you know that over [1.7 million
scholarships](https://educationdata.org/scholarship-statistics) are awarded
each year? At SFBU, we are proud to be among the number of colleges and
universities that help students get the funds they need to get a higher
education. Scholarships come in all shapes and sizes. But before we get into
the nuts and bolts of applying for a scholarship, let's talk about how you
should prepare.
## 1\. Get that University Scholarship by Staying Organized
You are getting ready to make one of the biggest decisions in your life: going
to college or university. You may be asking yourself, "If I want to get a
computer science scholarship, how do I do it?" We use computer science as our
example in this article, but you can apply for an SFBU scholarship in many of
our programs. Still, before you do, it is important to always stay organized
and don't let your nerves get the best of you.
Yes, when you apply for a scholarship, you are doing so in conjunction with
many other applicants. But don't worry. Stay calm and focused and properly
organize and prepare your materials. Staying organized is the key to putting
your scholarship application together. You will be asked to prepare multiple
documents for submission and verification. And since you are competing with
other applicants, staying organized keeps you ahead of the game.
Whether it be your transcripts, or personal statements, everything must be
well organized and ready for submission. Remember to have a comprehensive list
at the ready with your volunteer involvement, extracurricular activities, and
transcripts included. Consider creating a calendar with all your scholarship
deadlines. Or you can rely on an app like [Microsoft To
Do](https://todo.microsoft.com/), which will help you stay organized and on
top of your required tasks.
## 2\. What Should You Put in Your Scholarship Statement?
Your personal scholarship statement represents one of the most important
aspects of your application process. It's vital that you spend some time
thinking about how to write your personal statement. You've got to do it in
such a way that it properly expresses who you are and why you deserve the
scholarship for which you apply.
A personal statement should also be well structured and written in a way that
will make you stand out. It should paint a positive picture of you as a
person, student, and potential scholarship recipient. Approach how you share
this information from a storytelling perspective. Here are just a few
questions to consider as you assess your personal statement:
  * What are your strongest personality traits?
  * Do you have attributes, qualities, skills, or talents that set you apart from other applicants?
  * Can you provide a list of what you consider major life accomplishments?
  * Why did you choose your area of study and what are your career goals?
  * How will the scholarship help you achieve your goals?
Also, consider breaking your personal statement into several manageable
segments. Start with an introduction that grabs your reader's attention. You
can include family background or circumstances that impact your need for
financial assistance here. Then construct the body of your statement out of a
paragraph or two, discussing the bullet points above. Finally, create a
conclusion and consider it your last chance to impress and persuade those on
the Scholarship Committee.
## 3\. When Should You Apply for a University Scholarship for Computer Science
or Other Programs?
You've heard the saying: The early bird gets the worm. Only in this case, the
worm happens to be a significant chunk of free money to help get you through
your studies. Many scholarship winners will attest to the fact that an early
application was critical to their success.
It is important to be aware of the timelines involved in a scholarship
application process. At SFBU, we operate on a semester system, thus, an early
application is as soon as the application window is open. For example, SFBU
opened our spring applications on April 5th, and the deadline to submit the
application is Oct 15th. As such, students who want to make the best
impression first should have their scholarship applications ready on or
shortly after April 5th. So, if yours isn't already in, get it in now!
Scholarships of all varieties are not infinite. Universities in California -
and elsewhere - have a specific amount of scholarship funding available. That
way, the earlier you apply, the more likely you'll be to receive the
scholarship award you want.
## 4\. Specific Steps Involved with Applying for an SFBU Scholarship
At SFBU, we offer several scholarships. They include:
  * President's Scholarship for California Community College (CCC) Transfer Students (Bachelors)
  * President's Scholarship - Bachelor's Degree (100% Tuition)
  * President's Scholarship - Master's Degree (100% Tuition)
To learn more about each of these scholarships, simply visit the [scholarships
and grants](/admissions/scholarships) section of our website. Applying for a
scholarship has three steps since the application is integrated with the
application for admission. Applicants don't need to apply separately or after
they have been admitted. We combine the process.
The steps are easy:
  * Select the scholarship option you want to apply for when you complete your [online application](/admissions/inquiry-form).
  * Then you will need to upload your scholarship personal statement.
  * The Scholarship Committee will review your application and you will be notified.
It really is as simple as that. There are no complicated steps or tough hoops
to jump through. San Francisco Bay University is proud to provide 100% tuition
assistance scholarships for students in the United States and around the
world. And we invite you, before you begin your scholarship application
process, to take a [virtual tour of our campus](/blog/alumni/virtual_tour)!
#  Why Should You Study Electrical Engineering?
![Three students are assembling electronics circuit
board](/sites/default/files/2022-08/Why-Electrical-Engineering-content.png)
Deciding what to study at university is never easy. Above all, when deciding
on a college or university major, prospective students need to follow their
passions. After all, it does you no good to study a topic that you simply
aren't interested in. In fact, according to a recent study, [only
46%](https://www.ngpf.org/blog/question-of-the-day/qod-what-percent-of-
college-graduates-end-up-working-in-the-field-of-their-major/) of college
graduates actually work in their field of study. The same respondents were
fairly divided regarding their prospects of finding a well-paying job in their
field of study. Fortunately, as a premier university in San Francisco, we
proudly offer cutting-edge degree programs. And an electrical engineering
degree is cutting-edge. Electrical engineering has been around for a long
time, at least [since 1821](https://newengineer.com/blog/the-history-of-
electrical-engineering-1508492), but electrical engineers are still in high
demand. It's an old discipline that's far from old-fashioned.
So, what makes electrical engineering so great? Well, for one, an electrical
engineer works at the forefront of developing new technologies for many
industries. From transportation and logistics to healthcare, construction, and
robotics - electrical engineers are a required component. Electrical engineers
also create and improve systems that provide a net benefit to society.
Finally, and this may be the most important factor of all, electrical
engineers are in high demand.
It's important to leverage potential career options against how much money
you'll make and the kind of work you'll be doing. That's why we wanted to take
a deeper dive into electrical engineering. We offer a [Master of Science in
Electrical Engineering](/academics/school-of-engineering/msee) (MSEE) program,
but is it right for you? What makes electrical engineering such a desirable
area of study and potential career option?
## What is the Difference Between Electrical Engineering and Electronic
Engineering?
Electricity is an integral part of modern life. It could be argued that the
discovery of alternating current and the advent of modern electricity was one
of the big societal game changers of all time. Electricity and power
generation touch just about every aspect of our lives. Let us count the ways:
  * Power generation
  * Transportation and logistics
  * Healthcare and medical technology
  * Quantum computing
  * Artificial intelligence (AI)
  * Cryptography
  * Communications
Here's a question everyone asks: What's the difference between electrical and
electronic? To put it simply, electrical engineers work with the supply and
flow of electricity. Conversely, electronic engineers create and engineer
physical devices that we use in our everyday lives. Electrical engineering
specifically touches on the actual harnessing of electricity. This could
include producing, delivering, storing, and transmitting power. Take one of
our neighbors here at SFBU as an example. Tesla is so close we could bring
them cookies. And they need a lot of electrical engineers. The proximity we
have to so many world-class companies is one of the upsides of being a
university in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Meanwhile, electronic engineering specifically refers to the creating,
designing, and testing of electrical circuits and components. Electronic
engineering also refers to integrating computer hardware and software systems.
All applicable fields apply to electronic engineering, from AI to computation
and communications.
We've talked about electrical engineering and what it is, but now the question
is why should you choose it? Out of all possible options, why should this area
of discipline be what you spend your valuable time studying?
## 1\. Money
As much as we hate to say it, money and pay are still primary motivating
factors for anyone selecting a major or career. Fortunately, electrical
engineers make a healthy living. According to the United States Bureau of
Labor Statistics, the reported [median salary for electrical
engineers](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electrical-
and-electronics-engineers.htm) in 2021 was $100,420 and for electronic
engineers, $104,820.
Electrical engineers currently have a good job outlook, on par with the
average for the United States right now. The BLS expects job opportunities to
expand by approximately 3% on an annualized basis. This would account for
approximately 9,000 new high-paying jobs.
There are even ways to make more than half-a-million dollars per year as an
electrical engineer. The key is to learn the attributes of a high-paying
engineering job and then properly position yourself within the marketplace.
## 2\. Specialization
Much like other high-tech majors, electrical engineering encompasses a wealth
of different job titles. They include, but are not limited to:
  * Electrical design engineer
  * Electrical control engineer
  * Power systems engineer
  * Circuits engineer
  * Electrical project engineer
  * Instrumentation engineer
  * Photonics specialist
  * Electrical reliability engineer
And the list doesn't end there. The fact is, if electricity fascinates you,
then a career in electrical engineering might be exactly what you're looking
for.
## 3\. Transferable Skills
Employers look for a diverse array of skills and fresh mindsets. Skills are
essential, but innovation comes from new ideas and different ways of working
to achieve your goals. Fortunately, the skills and innovative thinking you get
from studying electrical engineering are easily transferred to other areas of
study and career options.
## 4\. High Demand
There's a huge benefit to the high demand for electrical engineers: The need
is global. There are not only high-paying electrical engineering jobs open all
over the world, there are a lot of them. Even in today's remote work
environment, electrical engineers are traveling to where their jobs are.
You'll be hard pressed to find electrical engineers that are wont for work.
From smartphones to medical devices and security systems, electrical engineers
design it all.
## 5\. It's Never Boring
New electrical devices and components, whether for consumer or commercial
applications, are invented and created every single day. When high-tech
devices go to market, companies backing these devices are already looking for
the next big thing. Companies build upon ideas and improve and innovate on
current technologies every day. And many of them, especially those that serve
universities in San Francisco, provide opportunities for their employees to be
a part of the next big thing in technology and electrical engineering.
If you are even remotely interested in electrical engineering as a discipline
for study in university, consider San Francisco Bay University. We are proud
to be a university in San Francisco dedicated to cutting-edge degree programs.
And we are even more proud to offer generous [scholarships, grants, and
tuition assistance](/admissions/scholarships) to help students who want to get
a degree in electrical engineering. Enroll today and future-proof your degree
decision!
## THINGS TO DO
#  Why Should You Get a Scholarship for an MBA in the USA?
![college students and teacher discussing ideas in
classroom](/sites/default/files/2022-12/MBA-USA-Scholarship-content.jpeg)
At San Francisco Bay University, we believe in providing a high-quality
education at prices students can afford. But what's better than an affordable
education? A near-free education! That's why we're proud to offer an array of
scholarships designed to help students worldwide get a first-class education
in the United States. Right here in the San Francisco Bay area, as a matter of
fact. Whether you are looking for a scholarship for an MBA in the USA or
another discipline, SFBU wants to help you realize your academic dreams. We
are proud to have students from the United States, India, Nigeria, and many
other parts of the world studying SFBU programs and being awarded
scholarships.
It's a fact that in most countries, pursuing higher education can be an
expensive endeavor. Whether it be tuition fees, housing, living expenses, or
otherwise - getting an education is not easy. And although university fees can
be expensive, students can get help. Let's take a closer look at why
scholarships are so important.
## 1\. Scholarships Make Education More Accessible
According to a study in U.S. News & World Report, the average cost for
bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees has [risen by
134%](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-
college/articles/see-20-years-of-tuition-growth-at-national-universities)
since 2002. These eye-popping numbers certainly have a discouraging effect on
students, no matter where in the world they are. For students in developing
countries, tuition in the tens of thousands of dollars puts a degree firmly
out of reach. All this is during a time when business-related degree programs
are more popular than ever. There is a reason why students look for
scholarships for MBA programs in the USA more than any other program.
Regardless of their area of study, securing financial aid through a
scholarship opens the door to opportunities that they wouldn't otherwise have.
Scholarships also allow students to be more selective about their degree
programs. It reduces their risk of dropping out and provides opportunities for
them to expand their academic experience, whether it be through internships or
study abroad programs.
## 2\. Support Through an Expanded Network
Many universities, including SFBU, offer students who are awarded a
scholarship for an MBA in the USA other types of financial support. Not only
do students gain access to scholarship funds, but they are generally guided by
an admissions specialist to ensure they make the best use of their funds. For
first-year students from foreign countries like Nepal or Ghana, mentorship
from a qualified professional can be a huge help. Expert advice isn't always
available when one doesn't know where to look. That's where qualified mentors
can help. Being on the receiving end of a scholarship opens the door to other
resource opportunities one may not have considered before.
Networking can seem intimidating in a foreign country. Attending a foreign
university and interacting with new types of people should be viewed as a net
positive, however. Getting a scholarship to a U.S.-based university allows you
to attend school-related events and activities. Expanding your network
increases both personal and professional development and spurs growth.
## 3\. Scholarships Provide Greater Flexibility and Opportunity
Many students do not actually want to work while they go to college or
university and would prefer to focus on their studies. Yet many students find
themselves taking on employment of some sort to help cover the cost of tuition
and other expenses. Even at a part-time job, 15 hours of work a week can be
quite disruptive to studies. This is where a scholarship comes in. Financial
assistance allows students to dedicate more of their time to their studies and
less to work. They are less tired, less stressed, and more productive in
school and other endeavors.
Scholarships also, in and of themselves, create more opportunities for the
recipients. They boost one's resume simply by being on it. Business leaders
all over the world view scholarships as prestigious awards. They demonstrate
outstanding merit on behalf of the student and elevate their academic and
professional profile.
## Are MBAs Still Important?
We've talked about scholarships, but let's get to the other half of this
title, and that's the MBA or Masters in Business Administration degree.
There's been a lot of chatter in the past few years that, as universities
churned out MBA graduates, the degree's usefulness became diluted. Back in
[2014](https://fortune.com/2014/05/31/mba-popular-masters-degree/), the MBA
was the most popular master's degree program in the United States, but some
may now question its value. Well, worry not. The MBA has staying power, and
its cachet is far from being spent.
In fact, MBAs are still considered one of the most prestigious degrees, both
in the United States and abroad. MBA degree programs in the USA are as varied
as the academic institutions that offer them. It is important that students
applying for MBA scholarships in the USA pick a proper specialization, but
they also need to decide whether they will get their degree through distance
learning. Here at SFBU, we are proud to offer [our classes
online](/blog/prospective/sfbu-now-offers-class-online) (as well as in a more
traditional in-person setting). This is what has made us such an appealing
choice for students from around the world.
Just consider for a moment the rapid advancement in technology and
manufacturing. Global businesses require more effective management techniques,
paradigm-shifting strategies, and future-proofed business practices. The fact
is that business management exists on the same level as medicine or the law.
Skilled management professionals keep the gears of commerce turning.
## The Early MBA
Although business management exists alongside medicine and law today, that
wasn't always the case. The concept was not well received in the 20th century.
It wasn't until the mid-20th century that industrialization kicked into full
gear and business managers became ubiquitous. Specific business standards and
labor laws were implemented to govern the use of sophisticated machinery. As
manual labor changed, the way businesses were managed also needed to change.
As new businesses and advanced manufacturing evolved, executive boards across
the country - and the world - began looking for ways to create more effective
management techniques. Managing a company well became something more akin to a
science than an art. Industry managers of all types needed to find ways to
address divisions of specialization, labor tasks, and workflow hierarchy. And
it would be the colleges and universities that answered the call to teach
these business owners and managers best practices in running an efficient
business. While the [first known business
school](https://www.mba.today/guide/mba-history) was established in 1819 in
Paris, by the mid-20th century universities and colleges were teaching
business and offering MBA scholarships in the USA for local and foreign
students.
Today, the core MBA curriculum includes accounting, business strategy,
economics, finance, and manufacturing and production. And yet, many
universities have expanded on those core competencies to include:
  * Operations Management
  * Globalization
  * Health Tech
  * Marketing and Advertising
  * Social Enterprise
MBAs have gone through a varied evolution since the first business school was
created over 200 years ago. Today, they are still considered to be a valuable
degree that imparts a diverse set of skills to those who earn one. And
scholarships represent a great opportunity for students who may not have the
funds up-front to receive a quality education. If you are a foreign student
curious about obtaining a scholarship for an MBA in the USA, we'd like to
propose Northern California. SFBU offers competitive programs and [generous
scholarships](/admissions/scholarships), tuition assistance, and grants. Now
is the time for an MBA from a prestigious university in the Bay Area. Our
phone number is +1-510-803-SFBU.

#  Our 10 Favorite Outdoor Activities in the Bay Area
![San Francisco Bay Area
View](/sites/default/files/2022-04/OutdoorActivities_lg.jpeg)
Welcome to bright and beautiful San Francisco! Here at SFBU, we are so proud
to be part of the San Francisco Bay Area. California's fourth-largest city
checks all the boxes when it comes to being a world-class metropolis. From
outstanding museums to great shopping, a diverse array of restaurants, and a
dynamic startup scene - San Francisco is the place to be for anyone who wants
to live in a city that has it all. No wonder students from all over the world
want to attend a university in San Francisco! Yet, this is a city that also
has plentiful natural beauty and open spaces.
Even though San Francisco is a bustling metro area, it boasts over [ 3,400
acres ](https://www.tpl.org/city/san-francisco-california) of wide open spaces
for people to explore and enjoy. In fact, there are so many green spaces in
San Francisco, every resident lives within a 10-minute walk of a park or green
space.
Of course, San Francisco's most famous public space is the Golden Gate Park,
which covers over 1,000 acres of lakes, gardens, and beautiful Redwood trees.
And yet, there are so many other smaller parks and open areas - from Hawk Hill
to Buena Vista Park - for residents and students to choose from. Even more,
there are plenty of options for those who want to leave the hustle and bustle
of the big city in search of adventure.
Just across the Golden Gate Bridge are the Marin Headlands, which are home to
nearly 140 miles of trails. For avid campers, a 25-minute ferry ride leads to
Angel Island State Park. The fact is, students attending SFBU have access to a
wide array of outdoor activities, from hiking to birdwatching and so much
more. That's why we want to tell you all about them in our latest blog. Let's
dig a little deeper into our 10 favorite outdoor activities in and around the
city we love.
## 1\. The Golden Gate Bridge and Park
We would be remiss if we did not start with the most iconic and well-known
structures and outdoor areas in the Bay Area: The Golden Gate Bridge. While
this may seem like an obvious first choice, the area around the Golden Gate
Bridge provides for spectacular outdoor fun. Golden Gate Park is the place to
go if you want to get out of the city without actually leaving the city.
Golden Gate Park offers a natural refuge for outdoors enthusiasts smack in the
middle of San Francisco's urban density. Covering an area nearly a mile-and-a-
half large, Golden Gate Park is big enough to whisk you away from the sights,
smells, and sounds of the city. Check out these points of interest within the
park:
  * Japanese Tea/Botanical Garden
  * National AIDS Memorial Grove
  * Strawberry Hill
  * Stowe Lake
  * Hippie Hill
You may even get the opportunity to check out a herd of American bison in the
park, which roam in an area near Spreckels Lake. These majestic animals have
been a treasured part of the park for over a century.
## 2\. Kayaking the San Francisco Bay
As a university in San Francisco, our students have access to a vast array of
outdoor activities. And one of the most popular of those activities includes
kayaking on the bay. Getting out on the water is an exciting and beautiful way
to get up close and personal with the waters around San Francisco.
Did you know that it is even possible to paddle out to watch a San Francisco
Giants game from the water? That's right! For a truly unique Northern
California experience, kayak out to McCovey Cove during a baseball game and
enjoy the roar of AT&T Park without the need for a ticket. For students who
may not have a kayak handy, [City Kayak](https://citykayak.com/) provides
rental options and information for potential kayakers.
For those who want real adventure, head out into San Francisco Bay and paddle
in the waters around Angel Island, Sausalito, Tamales Bay, and many other
locations. For more information on kayaking safely in San Francisco Bay, check
out the [Bask Bay Area Sea Kayakers page](https://www.bask.org/kayak-safely/).
## 3\. The Mount Sutro Open Space Reserve
Just a few blocks south of Golden Gate Park is a 61-acre green space owned by
the University of California, San Francisco. Many have described this idyllic
space to be similar to a cloud forest. The iconic fog that rolls in from the
bay creates a magical setting atop the reserve. And it is the perfect place to
escape from the heat of the sun during a hot San Francisco day.
For those looking for a good hike, the reserve also contains over five miles
of hiking and mountain-biking trails. Adventure seekers and casual hikers
alike will love the Historic Trail or the West Ridge Trail before heading to
the Mount Sutro summit itself. The North Ridge is another great option, which
loops through old-growth blue-gum eucalyptus and cedar trees.
## 4\. Fort Funston
Just across from Lake Merced Park and San Francisco State University lies Fort
Funston and Funston Beach, long a favorite of San Francisco residents and
visitors alike. Established in 1900, the area was originally the Lake Merced
Military Reservation. It was in 1917 that a fort was constructed and the area
renamed Fort Funston.
With windswept views of the beach and a large network of trails around the
fort, Fort Funston offers plenty of activities for nature lovers. Birdwatchers
will enjoy large colonies of bank swallows nesting in the nearby sandstone
cliffs. It's one of only two places in California where these endangered birds
nest.
Finally, consider Fort Funston for sunset. Sit atop the hill and gaze upon the
setting sun as it dips below the Pacific Ocean. San Francisco residents will
tell you, this is the best spot in town to catch a gorgeous sunset.
## 5\. Buena Vista Park
Translated from Spanish meaning "good view," Buena Vista Park is the most
appropriately named - and oldest - park in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Students visiting the park will find beautiful views of the Golden Gate Bridge
and Marin Headlands through thick groves of Cork Oak and Bailey's Acacia
trees.
Established in 1867, the hill in Haight-Ashbury also has an interesting past.
The northeast staircase at the entrance of the park contains a peace symbol
made of flower paintings. It's a piece of art that nods to San Francisco's
past when Buena Vista Park was the center of San Francisco counterculture.
For provisions on your way to the park, stop by the [ Haight Street
Market](https://gussmarket.com/market-locations/haight-street-market-san-
francisco/), which is only a five-minute walk from the park. And here's an
insider tip for you: You don't need to hike to the top of the hill for the
best views. Instead, find "The Window," an opening located lower on the west
side of the park. The views of the Marin Headlands and Drakes Bay are
spectacular.
## 6\. San Francisco Beaches
We would be remiss if we did not add any beach activities to this list. After
all, as a coastal city, enjoying the sun and surf is quintessential to being a
San Franciscan. Your first stop should be Baker Beach, which is located near
the Golden Gate bridge. As part of the Golden Gate National Recreation area,
this is a great place to relax after a long, hot day of hiking. Just keep in
mind the water here is generally not safe for swimming.
China Beach is another visually stunning beach with a northward facing view of
the Marin Headlands and the Golden Gate Bridge. The rock walls on both sides
of the beach create a small protected area that once was a camp for Chinese
fishermen, hence the name. And the area just south of the cove is called Lands
End, where you'll find an interesting hidden surprise called the [Lands End
Labyrinth](https://www.californiabeaches.com/attraction/lands-end-labyrinth/).
Another interesting hidden gem are the Sutro Baths, which are calm saltwater
and freshwater pools. This historical site is surrounded by a beautiful beach
and stunning green headlands. It's a lesser-known area with a unique history.
Also consider:
  * Kirby Cove Beach
  * Rodeo Beach
  * Muir Beach
  * Bolinas Beach
## 7\. The Marin Headlands
We've mentioned it enough throughout this article, so why not share some of
its history and appeal? Known for its unique geology and fog-swept coastal
prairie ecosystem, the Marin Headlands are a diverse and historic part of San
Francisco's natural history. With dramatic cliffs of oceanic rock offering
sweeping views of the Golden Gate Bridge, this area is a must-do for students
yearning for some fresh air and natural wonder.
The centerpoint of the Marin Headlands is the 920-foot Hawk Hill, which
(attention birdwatchers!) is the lookout point for the largest known flight of
diurnal raptors in the Pacific states, hence the name. Not only is Hawk Hill a
prime destination for biologists, it also holds great appeal for hikers and
cyclists.
The Marin Headlands human history is long and layered. It's original occupants
were the Coast Miwok Native Americans, who lived there for thousands of years.
In modern times, it evolved into a military hot spot for coastal defense
during the Cold War. Today, it serves as a welcome spot for local and
international visitors looking for a taste of natural San Francisco.
## 8\. Quarry Lakes Regional Recreation Area
We couldn't very well provide a list of outdoor activities in San Francisco
without paying some attention to options right here in Fremont. SFBU students
won't have to go far to get away and enjoy some fresh air.
Let's start with the Quarry Lakes Regional Recreation Area. Located on the
east bay side in Fremont, it's a large regional park with several man-made
lakes that offers picnicking, boating, swimming, and trails for hiking and
wildlife viewing. The trails are wide and it's fairly easy to walk around the
various lakes.
Students can utilize the lake for water-related activities, from swimming to
fishing, windsurfing, and boating. The area is also used to recharge aquifers
in the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin, so it is not only a great place for
outdoor activities, it supports the water needs of millions of San
Franciscans.
## 9\. Mission Peak
Mission Peak rises steeply to the east behind Fremont and offers a nice hike
for those who want to peak a mountain without leaving the Fremont area. It's
also a popular place for parasailing and hang gliding as the winds off San
Francisco Bay rise up its sides. You can also enjoy some stunning views of
other mountain ranges from its peak, including:
  * Mount Tamalpais
  * Mount Diablo
  * Mount Hamilton
Both experienced and novice hikers can find accommodating trails in the hills
in and around Mission Peak. With trails and parkland easily accessible from
the SFBU campus, this is a first stop for student adventurers seeking fresh
air and sun.
## 10\. The Arden Historic Farm
And for our final entry on this list, we bring you to the Ardenwood Historic
Farm, an unexpected option for SFBU students looking for something more off
the beaten path. It offers a glimpse into life on an American family farm
between 1890 and 1930. International students can expect a fascinating look
into the history of their host country.
While the farm makes up the remnants of a once vast private estate, today it
is a working farm open to the public. Staff and volunteers utilize carefully
restored farm machinery to harvest and process crops once common in the
region. There's also a farmyard with a variety of animals, a large hay barn,
an outdoor kitchen, and a working blacksmith. Being a historic farm, you can
expect renovated, but historically accurate buildings, beautiful grounds, and
a lovely Victorian farmhouse with formal gardens.
Today, Ardenwood demonstrates the vital role farms have played in providing
resources, driving innovation, and bringing and keeping communities together.
To find out what activities and schedules are around the farm - as well as
information for other East Bay parks - check out the East Bay Regional Park
District's [Naturalist Program
Schedule](https://www.ebparks.org/programs/naturalists). This should be your
resource for parks and recreation information in Fremont and the surrounding
Wow, what a list, right? We had a blast putting it together! As SFBU students,
we understand you work hard, so you deserve to get out and enjoy the beauty
the Bay Area has to offer. As a Northern California university, we are
grateful for the natural wonders of our state. Enjoy them!
#  10 Job Interview Tips for SFBU Graduates
![A student is having
interview](/sites/default/files/2022-04/JobInterview_lg.jpg)
Well, you've graduated. You put in all that time, effort, and hard work to
obtain a world-class degree from San Francisco Bay University. So, that's it,
right? The hard part is over and now it's time to party! Wrong. Certainly, you
should celebrate. Completing one of [SFBU's
programs](https://sfbu.edu/academics) is no small task. Bask in the glory. But
that doesn't mean there is no more work left to do.
Now, it's time to put that degree to good use and land yourself a job - and
build a career - that you love. But how do you do that? How do you apply the
skills you've learned to get a job in your field of study? And how do you
stand out in a crowd of recent college graduates? Don't worry, that's where we
come in.
Fortunately, all it takes is a little preparation. From researching the
company to practicing your interview skills and following up after the
interview - each of these steps will get you a little closer to "You're
hired!" So, without further delay, let's dig into each of our top interview
tips, plus a couple extra for good measure!
## 1\. Research the Position and Company You're Interviewing For
Even though companies across the country face a worker shortage, that doesn't
mean landing an interview and getting the job is a cake-walk. Employers notice
when you attend a college or university in Northern California because the
California university system is held in high regard. And if you apply for a
job in California, you will be competing with students who've all had a
stellar education. It is vital that you stand out and prove to your potential
employer that you've done your homework and deserve the job more than all
those other people.
Researching the company before you actually go to the interview shows
initiative. It allows you to talk more knowledgeably about why you think you
are a good fit for the company. It also demonstrates your interest and
enthusiasm for the job. And finally, it shows a high level of professionalism
and diligence. Consider researching the following about your prospective
employer:
  * Products
  * Services
  * Mission Statement
  * History
  * Culture
Now that you've done your research, it's time to prepare yourself for the
questions that are sure to come.
## 2\. Prepare Thoughtful Answers to Common Questions
Regardless of where you interview, it is highly likely you will get this
question: " _Why do you want to work here?_ " While this question may seem
benign, the interviewer is asking it for a specific reason. They want to know
how much time you took to research the company! We've covered the research
options above, now you have to prepare your answers.
As you answer questions, ensure you mention the aspects of the company that
appeal to you and align with your career goals. Does the company donate to
causes you support? Do they offer benefits you find particularly appealing?
These are appropriate points of common interest. Feel free to use them as you
demonstrate your knowledge of the company.
## 3\. Prepare Intelligent Questions to Ask Your Interviewer
A job interview is a two way street. Not only is it about finding out if you
are a good fit for the company; it's also about if they are a good fit for
you. Your questions go a long way in determining this. And knowing what
questions to ask demonstrates just as much initiative as asking the right
questions. If you end up sitting there only talking when talked to, it's
highly unlikely you'll get a call back.
A good rule of thumb is to prepare at least two questions to ask your
interviewer, and more if you feel comfortable. Memorize them if you can. You
want to ask questions specific to the company, but also consider the following
generic options:
  * What would a typical day in the position look like?
  * How would you describe the company culture?
  * What are your biggest challenges/opportunities at the moment?
  * What is your favorite/least favorite thing about working here?
  * How do you measure performance/success?
Also, consider creating a one-minute "elevator pitch" to explain your
experience. Be simple and concise. You don't want to come off as arrogant or
long-winded.
So, you've done your research and figured out appropriate questions. What's
next? It's time to practice, practice, practice!
## 4\. Practice With a Friend
You can prepare all you want, but if you don't apply your preparation to real-
world practice, you'll never become an expert. You won't be ready.
Deliberately practicing what you have prepared has several beneficial effects.
Not only do you get better at doing what you practice, but you increase the
odds of success ("You're hired!") when it matters most. You'll also start to
replace old habits with new habits. Research shows [the power of
habits](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2020/11/career-lab-habits) and how to
change, modify, or develop them.
Practicing with a friend also provides you with the ability to correct
mistakes. The last thing you want to do is slip up while you're in the
interview. Be sure to give your practicing partner the green light to be
critical, provide honest advice, and give tips and pointers where applicable.
You don't want them to be afraid to critique you. Once you feel ready, it's
time to take a deep breath and head to the interview! Let's talk about the
impression you want to make.
## 5\. Dress Professionally, Be Clean, and Well-Groomed
The power of practice is not the only one proven (say that five times fast!).
There is also a lot of power in the _first impression_. There is plenty of
research to prove [first impressions are long-
lasting](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/studying-first-
impressions-what-to-consider). How you dress and groom yourself is absolutely
a part of your overall evaluation for the job. Dress professionally, practice
good hygiene, cut your hair, and look your best. This is the time to do it.
Today, we live in the age of Zoom, so you may end up doing interviews
remotely. That doesn't mean, however, that it should be business up top and
casual on the bottom. When you dress professionally from head to toe, it helps
you get into the right mindset. Don't short change how you look simply because
you are not physically in the room with your interviewer.
## 6\. Bring a Resume, Notebook, Pen, and Business Cards
Being prepared for the interview goes beyond questions and answers. Make sure
you show up with the tools you need to follow along, take notes, ask follow up
questions, and leave your contact info. No matter how much you prepare, it is
likely you will need to write something down. Doing so also shows initiative.
It proves to your interviewer that you come ready, no matter the situation.
If you are concerned about walking into your interview with an armful of
items, consider a thin laptop bag or portfolio. This way you can organize your
things and add a bit of flash and pizzazz to your first impression.
## 7\. Arrive 10 to 15 Minutes Early
There's a saying: Being early is arriving on time. And when it comes to job
interviews, it is absolutely true. Arriving early isn't only about impressing
your interviewer. It's also about allowing yourself some time to de-stress,
take a deep breath, and collect your thoughts. You'll have time to go over
your questions again and prepare your answers.
Consider the journey as well. In today's society, it is a little too easy to
rely on your smartphone to get around. But phones run out of power and GPS
signals and maps aren't always reliable. After the experience of attending a
university in San Francisco or the surrounding area, you are well aware of how
congested the traffic can be. Plan your journey, mark your directions, and
leave extra early to account for the unexpected. And if you do rely on an app,
consider [Waze](https://www.waze.com/), as it will alert you to unexpected
events that other map apps might miss.
## 8\. Turn Off Your Cell Phone
This may seem obvious, but far too many people make the mistake of not
silencing their phone during an interview. Sure, you may not get passed over
simply because it accidentally rings, but your interviewer is evaluating every
aspect of the interview. Not silencing your cell phone shows a lack of
preparation and will reflect as a ding against you.
Turning your cell phone off also prevents distractions. With the tons of
notifications we all get on our phones all day long, the last thing you need
is noises or vibrations of all types causing you to forget one of your
important questions. Also, avoid checking your phone during the interview.
Nothing says "I couldn't care less" more than when you look at your phone
while you are interacting with someone, interview or no.
## 9\. Treat Every Person You Meet Politely and With Respect
Being polite and respectful is important not just because it might get you a
job, but because it is the _right thing_ to do. It also demonstrates
professionalism and the ability to get along with people, which are both
pretty important when it comes to working with others.
Consider that you are probably being evaluated not just on how you treat your
interviewer, but also on how you treat the receptionist or other office
workers. If you are nice to your interviewer but rude to everyone else, don't
expect to get the job. Demonstrate a sunny demeanor, smile a lot, and be
gracious. Consider this advice not just for a job interview, but for life.
## 10\. Be Confident and Make Eye Contact During Your Interview
You don't want to have a disconnect between what you say and how you act. You
can have all the best answers and ask all the right questions, but if you
aren't confident, your interviewer will see that. Sit up straight, don't
mumble, and make eye contact with your interviewer.
There is a fine line between confidence and arrogance. Both stem from one's
belief in oneself, but arrogance is a result of an exaggerated sense of self.
Sure, you just graduated from the best university in San Francisco and the Bay
Area, but don't make that the sole focus of your interview. Don't spend the
entire time talking about your accomplishments, but when you do, tie them back
into how they will enhance your ability to do the job you're applying for.
## Your Two Bonus Tips
Wow! That was fun, right? Well, we aren't done yet. We've got a couple bonus
tips for you to ensure you ace your post-SFBU interview. These final tips will
be the cherry on top of your successful job interview.
First, consider using the S.T.A.R. method as you answer questions and interact
with your interviewer. The acronym stands for:
  * **S** ituation: A situation you had to deal with.
  * **T** ask: The task you were given to do.
  * **A** ction: The action you took.
  * **R** esult: What happened as a result and what you learned from the experience.
If you have problems coming up with ways to explain your accomplishments, the
S.T.A.R. method may help. Indeed, many interviewers use the S.T.A.R. method
themselves when evaluating what questions to ask, so if you use it in
preparing answers, you are ahead of the game.
And finally, don't forget to give thanks. Thank your interviewer for the
opportunity to speak in person or over Zoom, then also thank them via email or
a hand-written note. After all, you want to make sure your last impression is
a good one.
Now that you've learned what you need to do, it's time to apply it. Ace your
next interview with SFBU's top tips for a winning interview!
#  Best Activities for Parents Visiting the Bay Area and SFBU
![Parents activities](/sites/default/files/2022-04/ParentsActivities_lg.jpeg)
Uh oh! Are your parents visiting you at SFBU and your room's a mess? Maybe you
just aren't ready to introduce them to all the wonderful things you've been
learning at one of San Francisco's premier universities. Well, that's okay! We
understand you've got a lot going on with your studies. That's why it is
important to recommend some awesome activities for your parents to enjoy while
you get fully prepped for their visit. Fortunately, we've got some great
recommendations to keep your parents occupied.
Consider how impressed your parents will be when you introduce them to all
these fabulous activities. As a student of SFBU, planning and time management
are important. So, why not prove to your parents how good you are at planning
and time management by suggesting some amazing San Francisco excursions for
them?
Consider that your parents have spent your life putting your interests ahead
of theirs. Perhaps now is the time to show them some of the same consideration
and attention. It's easy to recommend museums, bars, theaters, or shopping.
But how about something unique for your parents who have helped you get to a
point where a world-class education at SFBU is possible? Here are some amazing
unique activities they (and even you!) can enjoy.
## 1\. Alcatraz Island
Alcatraz Island is a fascinating place for anyone, from parents to students,
friends, and family. Alcatraz reveals stories of American incarceration,
justice, and our common humanity. It has been many things over the years, from
a fort to a military prison and maximum-security federal penitentiary. It was
even once occupied by the [American Indian
Movement](https://www.britannica.com/topic/American-Indian-Movement) in the
name of freedom and Native American civil rights.
When it was a prison, some of the most infamous names in criminality were
imprisoned there, from Al Capone to George "Machine Gun" Kelly. The cells in
Alcatraz measure 10 feet by 4.5 feet. Could you imagine being imprisoned in
such a place? In 1972, Alcatraz became part of the newly created Golden Gate
National Recreation Area. And although there has been no effort to repair the
structures on the island, their general decay and disrepair only add to the
disquiet that surrounds the facility. This is one of the top tourist
destinations in San Francisco and for good reason!
For more information on operating hours, seasons, and more, visit the website
for the National Park Service by clicking or tapping [
here](https://www.nps.gov/alca/planyourvisit/index.htm).
## 2\. The California Academy of Sciences
We wanted to offer something more than the casual museum experience. So, why
not recommend your parents visit the California Academy of Sciences? This
attraction offers things to see and do beyond a simple museum. It also offers
a Natural History Museum, an aquarium, a planetarian, and more. It's even
become a go-to for the scientific community. And for those of you who have
parents fond of architectural wonders, they will be interested to learn that
the entire facility underwent a conversion in 2008 by the Italian architect
Renzo Piano. Today, the Academy is a green building with a design that has
become an iconic part of the culture and history of San Francisco.
The Academy also offers state-of-the-art technology and design to dazzle and
wow you and your parents. The planetarium boasts the world's largest all-
digital dome with a 360-degree surround screen that will transport you to
distant worlds and galaxies. From short films in Hohfeld Hall to rainforest
recreations and a live penguin display, there's a lot to learn - and love - at
the California Academy of Sciences.
The California Academy of Sciences is open from 9:30am to 5:00pm every day
except Sunday when they are open 11:00am to 5:00pm. Tickets are $35.95 for
adults, $30.95 for seniors, and $25.95 for children 4 to 11. Children under 3
get in free. For more information click or tap
[here](https://www.sanfrancisco.net/california-academy-sciences).
## 3\. Sunset Dinner at The Cliff House
Your parents will thank you for recommending a romantic dinner at the elegant
Cliff House. With two options - either the Bistro Restaurant or Sutro's
Restaurant - your parents will dine well and enjoy a spectacular view of the
sunset over the Pacific Ocean. On Sundays, the terrace room offers a champagne
brunch buffet with all-you-can-drink champagne and a live harpist. There is
also a Friday night jazz offering, because whose parents don't like a seaside
dinner, sunset, and jazz?
In the end, it really isn't about what day of the week your parents visit.
Instead, it's about the amazing view and excellent ambiance. No matter what
table you're sitting at, you'll get an awesome view of the Marin headlands and
Sea Rocks. They even offer a California seaside-inspired lunch that is based
purely on the catch of the day.
Prices are modest and reservations are recommended as this is a popular spot
with San Franciscans and out-of-town visitors alike. A recommendation to the
Cliff House will surely impress your parents and remind them that you've got
their comfort and entertainment in mind! Click or tap here to go to their
[website](https://cliffhouse.com/).
## 4\. Fisherman's Wharf
The only reason we did not make this the number one option is simply because
that would have been too obvious. Whether you are new to the San Francisco
area or not, you've likely heard of or been down to Fisherman's Wharf. It is
usually high on the list of things to do for those visiting the Bay Area.
Fisherman's Wharf was known for being a cultural hot spot back in the early
days of the city.
/p>
When eager prospectors were participating in the San Francisco Gold Rush,
Chinese immigrants were catching salmon, shrimp, and oysters and selling it
all at Fisherman's Wharf. Before long Italians, Irishmen, and many others from
all over the world began adding their cultural beliefs and styles to the
diverse milieu that was becoming San Francisco Bay. From Fleet Week to the
raucous, carnival-like atmosphere at Pier 39, Fisherman's Wharf is a
cornucopia of fun and a feast for the senses.
From the Wharf, your parents can head on down to Hyde Pier, which is a world
apart from "modern" San Francisco. From the paddlewheel tug to the old fishing
boats and schooners, Hyde Pier will take your parents back in time as they
gaze upon the San Francisco of yesterday. Visit Fisherman's Wharf's
[website](https://www.fishermanswharf.org/things-to-do/) for the official list
of things to do on the Wharf and beyond.
## 5\. Ride the Cable Car
Who doesn't love to ride in a cable car and take in the beautiful vistas
around them? This is one activity that has made San Francisco immortal, if for
nothing else than the number of movies that have featured the Powell-Hyde
cable car. The cable cars will take you and your parents along three routes
where they can visit the most popular parts of San Francisco. From Fisherman's
Wharf to Union Square, Aquatic Park, Lombard Street, and finally Nob Hill -
your parents will see it all without having to worry about being stuck in
traffic or waiting for a cab. Dazzle your parents as you point out the 1873
red cars with the golden bells in front. There is even a cable car museum they
can check out if they want to learn more.
The cable car rides are scheduled at 10-minute intervals throughout the day.
They start at Union Square and end at Nob Hill. Tickets cost around $6 USD for
those between 5 and 64, and $3 USD for the disabled and seniors. Check out all
the history and ride and payment information at the official San Francisco
Cable Car [website](https://www.sfcablecar.com/)!
Well, we hope you've enjoyed this romp through some of the best activities to
recommend to your parents when they visit you at San Francisco Bay University.
Consider that there is also so much more you can recommend. From trying out
Papalote's burritos to Mojo's sandwiches and Little Star's pizza, there are
awesome foodie options for them to discover in the Bay Area as well.
Sure, your parents may have heard stories that San Francisco is full of crime
and overpriced avocado toast, but as an SFBU student, you know that's not the
case. That's why it's important to introduce them to the San Francisco you
know and love. Make them proud of you and your consideration for their needs
while they visit our fair city. And finally, enjoy the best things to do in
San Francisco for you and your parents!
#  Is a Master's of Electrical Engineering Program Right for You
![Two Male College Students Building Machine In Science Robotics Or
Engineering-content.jpeg)
Are you interested in a career in electrical engineering? If so, consider the
benefits of enrolling in a master's of electrical engineering program.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics from 2021 to 2031 overall
employment of electrical and electronics engineers is projected to [grow by
3%](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electrical-and-
electronics-engineers.htm)? That may not seem like a lot, but when you
consider the contraction happening in many other industries, a career in
electrical engineering might not be such a bad idea.
Also, consider the level of pay electrical engineers enjoy. According to the
same BLS statistics, electrical engineers start out in six figures with a
degree in hand. In 2021, the average median pay for an electrical engineer was
[$101,780 per year](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-
engineering/electrical-and-electronics-engineers.htm), certainly nothing to
shake a stick at. Yet, a career in electrical engineering may not be for
everyone. It is important you do a careful evaluation of your career goals to
determine whether the field is right for you.
## A Masters of Electrical Engineering as a Forever Career
Can you imagine a world without the use of electricity? There is little doubt
that electricity is one of the most civilization-changing inventions of
humankind. Today, in the 21st century, electricity touches every aspect of our
lives. From the moment you wake up until you go to bed, electricity is with
you. And because electricity is so ubiquitous in our lives, there are a lot of
different types of electrical engineers and electrical engineering
professionals.
Hence, there is a lot of scope for professionals holding an electrical
engineering degree from a top engineering university in San Francisco. The
fact is electrical engineering is a promising career option for young
professionals as there are literally thousands of job opportunities available
in the field. You can work in any field that uses electricity. Just consider
that electricity touches almost every field and industry. No matter where you
want to work, chances are electricity is used in some fashion.
Today, job security is on everyone's mind. With inflation hitting [40-year
highs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-13/core-us-inflation-
rises-to-40-year-high-securing-big-fed-hike) and instability plaguing the
globe, everyday people worry about whether their job is on the chopping block.
Fortunately, for electrical engineers, job security is virtually guaranteed.
Those who obtain a master's in electrical engineering degree can rest assured
that their skills will be in high demand for a long time to come. Of course,
if you have already obtained your bachelor's degree in electrical engineering,
then you probably have already done your career due diligence. You've already
chosen this field of study. Now, you may be wondering what's next. What can
you expect to learn as you take your electrical engineering studies to the
next level?
## What Will You Study as You Pursue Your MSEE?
The Master of Electrical Engineering is a 2-3-year degree (full-time)
depending on your prior study. In your first year (or equivalent) you'll
complete foundation engineering subjects. These subjects are specifically
tailored to students from non-engineering backgrounds. If you've completed the
Electrical Systems major in the Bachelor of Science at another university,
plus the required math and science subjects, then you will get credit for
these foundation engineering subjects.
By your second or third year of studies, it will be time to dig into your area
of specialty. It will be time to put some time into your desired discipline.
Your professors will guide you in acquiring and honing the core skills you
need to excel in your chosen discipline. You can expect to study things like:
As part of your advanced studies, you can also expect to be assigned an
industry, design, or research project. This project will be used by your
professors to evaluate the knowledge you've gained and retained.
## Is a Master's in Electrical Engineering Worth It?
It is important to remember that an MSEE is not usually a career requirement.
However, it is recommended if students and professional engineers want to
enhance their skills. Of course, undergraduate degrees are important, as they
help students gain a fundamental knowledge of basic sciences. This generally
includes physics, mathematics, and engineering. And while many engineers go on
to get great jobs with just a bachelor's degree, it may limit the scope of
positions they may qualify for.
That's where a master's degree comes in. Master's programs are specifically
designed to help students hone skills that will be essential for a long and
lucrative career in electrical engineering. The skills learned in a master's
program include strong technical, creative, communication, problem-solving,
and critical-thinking skills. They will serve the master's graduates in more
than just their engineering field. These are life skills that will come in
handy in numerous circumstances.
Beyond learning new skills, graduating with a master's in electrical
engineering can boost a candidate's job prospects. For those looking for new
or enhanced career opportunities and a higher salary, an MSEE will provide
them. It is also important to remember that employers may require specialized
electrical engineering applicants to have a master's degree with a specialty
in the area of focus they are looking for.
The same goes for leadership positions. Many employers require a master's
degree for project manager or senior engineer positions. Not only is a wealth
of experience important, but that advanced degree may be just what is needed
to get that lucrative leadership position. In the end, earning a master's
degree can improve an individual's employment opportunities and income
potential. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), median
weekly earnings for individuals with a master's degree were nearly $250
greater than for those with just a bachelor's, while the unemployment rate for
master's holders was almost 1.5% lower.
Here at San Francisco Bay University, we proudly offer MSEE programs designed
to help students accelerate their careers and reach new heights. We also offer
[generous scholarship programs](/admissions/scholarships) and tuition
assistance for students who need it. Contact our admissions office to learn

#  A Virtual Tour of the San Francisco Bay University Campus
![San Francisco Bay University
Building](/sites/default/files/2022-04/CampusTour_lg.jpeg)
Welcome to San Francisco Bay University! We are so proud to introduce you to
our brand new campus, opened in January of 2022. Located in beautiful Fremont,
California, our new campus reflects our status as one of the premier
universities in San Francisco Metro. SFBU offers a remote learning environment
for certain programs, but that does not mean we skimped on our in-person
campus, which is beautiful, accommodating, and retrofitted for a 21st-century
Did you know that as of 2021, [54% of U.S.-based university
students](https://www.statista.com/topics/4553/college-student-health-in-the-
us/) agreed or strongly agreed that their health and well-being were
prioritized at the college or university they were attending? This may seem
great, but that means almost half of the rest of the students surveyed said
their health and well-being were not priorities. Here at SFBU, we are proud to
provide a facility that comfortably falls within the 54% who feel like their
health and well-being are prioritized, and our new campus reflects that.
Many of our campus improvements include hub-type areas that allow students to
learn together in an accommodating and collaborative environment. After all,
both professors and students want to have a comfortable place to learn, work,
and have quality conversations about the programs they are in. But the
question is: What are the specific improvements we have brought to our new,
beautiful campus? Let's take a deeper look into the new SFBU.
## Learning Resource Center
Our new learning resource center is designed to provide students with a space
to study, learn, and collaborate. SFBU's learning resource center offers a
self-learning environment, perfect for learning and mastery utilizing several
different mediums, whether audio, visual, or otherwise. Information and
computing technology have changed the way university learning centers operate,
and ours is no exception. We draw upon the latest technologies to ensure our
students have access to the information they need to become masters in their
subjects.
## New Computer Labs
As a university in California that offers programs in Computer Science and
Electrical Engineering, we want to make sure our students have high tech
computer labs to utilize as they work on their programs. SFBU students can
expect the latest high-speed computers, lightning fast fiber internet, and
comfortable seats and desks. Even better, we provide multiple computer labs
for students to use. That way, there is enough space for everyone who needs to
use a computer to help them complete their studies.
## Faculty Offices
Our faculty deserve only the best. Why? Because they provide the best
education for SFBU students. Our fully renovated faculty offices provide
everything our professors need to ensure our student body receives a first-
class education. There is a reason we are one of the top-tier San Francisco
universities, and this is reflected in our new faculty office design.
## Cafe and Dining Hall
Students will have a hard time focusing on their studies if they are not well
fed, hydrated, and enjoying access to a fully stocked cafe and dining area. We
understand students attending California universities and colleges have a high
expectation of the services they receive. That's why here at SFBU, once COVID
restrictions are lifted, we will proudly offer meal plans balanced with
healthy proteins, vegetables, fruit, and starches. We will also have vending
machines for quick eats and our dining areas have comfortable seating, bright
lighting, and wide open spaces for students to get comfortable as they eat,
talk, and collaborate. We're looking forward to the lifting of COVID
restrictions so SFBU students can safely enjoy the dining hall and cafe
together!
## Outdoor Quad
There is nothing like a little fresh air and sun after you've been studying
hard inside our new campus. That's why we designed our outdoor quad to provide
a comfortable space for our students to relax in the warm San Francisco sun
and air. It's a comfortable green space with chairs, tables, and trees. It is
the perfect space for students, faculty, and administrative staff alike to
unwind after a long day of study and hard work.
## Administrative Offices
Our fully redesigned administrative offices provide a perfect environment for
our administrative staff. This is where our back-office personnel helps SFBU
students get through the application process. Our administrative staff proudly
helps students through their application process. Without them, From new desks
and computers to wide open spaces, bright lighting and lots of windows, these
are office spaces that administrative staff can be proud of!
## Upgraded Classrooms
SFBU students attending class onsite can expect to learn in an environment
that contains fixed and mobile seating, adequate lighting, plenty of space to
move around, power outlets, and big boards that professors can use as they
instruct the students. We've designed our classrooms with our student body in
mind and we are convinced those that learn onsite will appreciate the effort
we have put into our state-of-the-art classrooms.
## New Lecture Hall
Students attending universities in the United States know that the lecture
hall is a critical component of any learning environment. Here at SFBU, our
new and improved lecture hall can be used not only for professorial lectures,
but for special events, seminars, and workshops. With open stadium seating
that can seat up to 70 people, and favorable acoustics, our new lecture hall
will be perfect for students and professors alike. For pre- and post-event
gatherings, the lecture hall opens into a large hallway perfect for long
tables and areas for people to stand and mingle.
## Quiet Study Area
San Francisco universities are full of the hustle and bustle of student
activity. That's why we wanted to make sure we provide SFBU students with a
way to study in a quiet environment. Our quiet study area offers comfortable
seating, soft lighting, and those who utilize it are encouraged to keep their
talking and noise to a minimum. This is where SFBU students find a quiet place
to study and gather their thoughts as they work on their SFBU programs.
## Recreation and Student Lounge
Our recreation and student lounge is designed to provide students with a
relaxing place to unwind, relax, and study. Whether you want to play foosball,
kick back and relax, or have a meet-up with your fellow students, this is the
perfect place to do it.
Here at SFBU, we have designed our spaces with students in mind. We have
utilized a wide-open hub-style approach. This way, students have easy access
to the space they need, whether it is the student lounge, dining hall, quiet
study area. Our spaces are filled with light, high ceilings and windows to
allow natural light in.
The San Francisco Bay University campus is located at 161 Mission Falls Lane
in beautiful Fremont, California, 94539. Stop by and have a look at what makes
our campus so special.
#  We're Proud to Be a University in Fremont California
![A group diversity students are taking the picture in front of SFBU
booth](/sites/default/files/2023-03/group-students-640.jpg)
It's quite likely you've heard of San Francisco, but you might not have heard
of Fremont. And yet, our hometown of Fremont, California is a hotbed of
innovation, culture, networking, community, and opportunity. While it may not
be the most well-known city, many of the companies and institutions that call
Fremont home are very well-known. Take Tesla, as one example. Fremont was the
site for Tesla's first manufacturing facility. Over time, many articles have
come out detailing the hard-working working nature of Californians. We're
proud to be a university in Fremont, California.
## Is Fremont the Happiest City in California?
You heard it here; Fremont is the happiest city in California. After WalletHub
[surveyed](https://wallethub.com/edu/happiest-places-to-live/32619) America's
182 biggest cities and Fremont, California came in first place! We're not just
the happiest city in California, we're the happiest city in the nation! It's
pretty incredible really. And it's why SFBU is happy to call this town home.
These happiness factors measured income, employment, community, and
environmental health.
Here's an interesting tidbit from the survey. Fremont had the lowest divorce
rate in the United States and the fourth-highest sports participation rate.
The fact is, Fremont is a strong and vibrant community with a city government
that has worked hard to maintain economic prosperity within the city. We are
surrounded by a lot of other cities. Indeed, being a suburb of San Francisco
is no small feat. But Fremont capitalizes on its unique location in the heart
of Silicon Valley. It is a technology-forward community that has created
growth without waste or bloated spending.
Just consider for a moment the changes that Fremont has made. Did you know the
final gasoline combustion car factory in California was right here in Fremont?
That's right. It closed in 2010. And guess who would go on to buy it? Elon
Musk. From the past to the future. While much of the manufacturing at Tesla is
done by machines, it still became the number one employer in Fremont very
quickly. As a university in Fremont, we are proud to have students who have
gone on to work for Tesla upon graduation.
## Innovation Happens in Fremont
There is a reason why so many companies come to Fremont. At one point Fremont
had [the most startups](https://www.thinksiliconvalley.com/blog/fremont-has-
most-startups-capita-nation-where-do-we-go-here/) per capita in the nation.
What sets Fremont apart is the innovation clusters that grow here. With some
of the most high-tech companies in America headquartered right here,
incubators, accelerators, and private equity firms have money to spend.
Longtime business professionals want to foster and grow companies that thrive
on innovation.
Although there are other tech hot spots sprouting around the country, the
[Silicon Slopes](https://www.siliconslopes.com/) being one example, none have
come close to eclipsing the sheer number of technology companies thriving in
our area. Fremont is also a very diverse city. More than 40% of Fremont's
population is foreign-born, which creates an environment of unique thought.
It's why our city is routinely thought of as an idea factory.
Being a dynamic, desirable city is what sets Fremont apart, and not only in
the entire Bay Area or even the state. But in the country. Fremont's
population has grown by over 10% in 2020 and its [median
income](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fremontcitycalifornia) is higher
than the national standard, at $142,474. We hate to say all the happiness is
about median income, but more money certainly does'nt hurt. Not all
universities in Fremont graduate as many students to some of these high-paying
jobs. We're proud to say we have.
## Beneficial Business Legislation in Fremont
Fremont has also created some interesting local ordinances and regulations to
stimulate business growth. One such example was the creation of the "[Small
Business Ally](https://www.thinksiliconvalley.com/blog/small-businesses-have-
new-ally-their-side/)" program nearly a decade ago. This program streamlined
the permitting process at City Hall. Rather than forcing new companies to go
through onerous red tape and endless bureaucracy, the City of Fremont assigned
a single point of contact assistant to help new businesses get their legs
under them. Having an individual on your side through the process prevents
unnecessary paperwork and helps you corral important documents.
Some worried that assigning a single administrator to the program was
dangerous. After all, that's a lot of power and responsibility on one person.
But it worked and the climate for small businesses and overall business growth
improved in Fremont proper. It also helps surrounding areas prosper.
Businesses had confidence that they had an ally on the inside and the state
government was able to quickly scale up business growth and tax receipts.
Today, Fremont's prosperity is clear and evident in the numbers. Fremont's
unemployment rate is only 2.6%. Highly skilled people from all over the world
come to Fremont to start companies and help other companies grow and succeed.
As a result, employers have a specific imperative to hire only the best
people, no matter where they come from. And while housing costs are on the
rise - as they are across the country - the city has expanded its services to
help the needs of its citizens.
## Lots For Students from a Fremont University to Do
One of the highlights of Fremont sits in the center of town. Many San
Francisco Bay University students meet, study, and network at the Block at
Pacific Commons and work in the Fremont Business Park, located on Christy
Street. The Block has quickly become one of Fremont's hottest entertainment
and shopping districts. The area around the Block and business park is a
hotbed of activity.
Fortunately, it's easy for students to get around Fremont and out to the wider
cities beyond. [Public transportation](/blog/current/sfbu-students-guide-how-
get-around-bay-area) servicing universities and colleges in Fremont is well-
developed and reliable. Students need not wait long to catch a train or bus.
There is also a wealth of different [outdoor
activities](/blog/current/outdoor_activities) well within reach of Fremont.
Whether students want to get outside or stay within the bounds of the city
proper, they have plenty of options. As a premier university in Fremont, SFBU
is proud to call this amazing city home. We invite prospective students from
around the world to consider Fremont when they consider an education. Learn

SFBU's student clubs are filled with eager students who want to connect with
the SFBU community. They serve as a forum for like-minded students to gather
and discuss certain topics and help each other succeed academically and
professionally. SFBU aids in creating these organizations to improve students'
lives. The university encourages students to become involved in campus
activities, gain new experiences, and enjoy their university experience.
If you are unable to attend the Club Rush Week, come and visit the Student
Life Department in Office 129 for more information.

inform their instructors and obtain permission. Administration must give final
